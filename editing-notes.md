# Notebook Editing Notes

- **Chronicling America API**
  - Should explain that it's now a general LoC API rather than just Chronicling America
  - Updated API: https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/loc.gov%20JSON%20API/Chronicling_America/README.html

- **OC Measurements**
  - Do we have an example of what the original query response looks like? bc the original search doesn't work, and search updated with taxon query still doesn't work

- **Datasette API**
  - CSTM api is dead on Heroku
    - https://cstm-demo.herokuapp.com/cstm/fulldata.json

- **Archdata in R**
  - Absolutely bunged, can't retrieve any data bc of cloudflare block
