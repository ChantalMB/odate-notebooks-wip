    "The [Portable Antiquities Scheme](http://finds.org.uk) (PAS) is a programme run by the British Museum and the National Museum of Wales. Small artefacts are often found in the course of gardening, metal detecting and other activities; the Scheme allows those finds to be recorded and those objects to become known. The Scheme has a database at [finds.org.uk/database](http://finds.org.uk/database) containing well over 1 million objects. The database exposes its records in a variety of ways to encourage scholarly re-use. Daniel Pett, who [designed and built](https://finds.org.uk/info) the database and webapi, wrote the following R code as a demonstration for how to query its API and retrieve photographic records."
