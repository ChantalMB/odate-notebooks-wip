            "description": "Description: A Middle to Late Bronze Age copper-alloy gold plated penannular ring. It is circular in cross-section and 5.11mm thick with a small gap to one side. There are a few small cracks on each surface revealing the copper-alloy core within and in places patches of copper-alloy corrosion have accumulated.\n\nDate: c.1300-c.800&nbsp;BC.\n\nDimensions: Diameter: 15.97mm, thickness: 5.11mm, weight: 9.21g\n\nDiscussion: Gold and gold-on-base-metal rings of this type, including penannular forms, are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1300&ndash;c.800 BC). &nbsp;Although variously termed &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; or &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; in the literature (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al. 2008; O&rsquo;Connor et al. 2008) their function remains unresolved (see Armbruster 2021, 191&ndash;196). Current consensus increasingly favours interpretation as items of personal adornment, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than as hair ornaments or units of exchange.\n\nInterpretation is, however, hampered by the fact that relatively few examples derive from secure archaeological contexts. Burial assemblages from Belgium, north-east France and the Netherlands, alongside Scottish and Irish hoard associations, suggest a floruit during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;c.800 BC) (Eogan 1997). However, growing evidence indicates an earlier origin and a longer period of manufacture and circulation than previously assumed (Raftery 2004, 87&ndash;88). Two examples from Scotland were recovered from a hoard and a cave site respectively, both associated with Late Bronze Age sequences dating to c.1150&ndash;c.800 BC. Although, given the predominantly southern English distribution of such rings, it is possible that their introduction occurred slightly earlier (Eogan 1997). On comparative stylistic grounds, the present example is therefore best dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (c.1300&ndash;c.800 BC).\n\nThe object contains more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.\n\nBibliography \n\nArmbruster, B. R. 2021.

            "description": "A complete cast copper alloy core of a penannular ring, probably dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age (c. 1300-800 cal&nbsp;BC).&nbsp;The ring is made of a bar that has a sub-triangular cross-section, with a flattened inner face and two flattened outer faces converging to a central ridge. This bar has been bent into an approximately circular loop with a small gap (2-3mm) between the two terminals.\n\nThe ring is mostly covered in a pale matte green-grey corrosion layer, which has fine pitting throughout, and is more brown in colour on the interior face of the ring. There are no traces of gold remaining on the surface, suggesting that perhaps this is an unfinished object that was never gold-plated.\n\nThe ring has a maximum outer diameter of 20.93mm, maximum inner diameter of 11.01mm, and a thickness of 5.61mm. It weighs 4.24 grams.\n\nA close parallel is recorded on the PAS database under NMS-97017C. Bronze penannular ring cores of slightly different shapes are recorded under&nbsp;PUBLIC-6A6D9E,&nbsp;LVPL-8FFAFD,&nbsp;LANCUM-165058&nbsp;and&nbsp;YORYM-9D0DD3, among others. There are some broken or damaged gold-plated examples that evidence a copper alloy core, under&nbsp;SF-3247BC,&nbsp;DUR-2FFBF0&nbsp;and BM-377122, for example. HAMP-259538&nbsp;is an example of a complete hollow gold penannular ring featuring&nbsp;a similar shape with a triangular cross-section.\n\nPenannular rings have been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal&nbsp;BC&nbsp;based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). They may well have a longer chronology within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC); This is now further supported by examples found with burials from Changis-sur-Marne, France, being radiocarbon dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1460-1290 cal&nbsp;BC) (Lafage et al. 2024, 339).

This pattern appears to be created by inlaying a continuous strip of silvery gold around the core, giving the impression of alternating bands of gold and silver. The entire copper alloy core is gold-plated, though there is some damage at the terminals that reveals&nbsp;the underlying copper core. The tapering of the stripes towards the centre suggests that the ring was bent into shape after the silver wire was inlaid.&nbsp;\n\nMeasurements\n\nDiameter: 17.80 mm; Thickness: 5.81 mm; Width: 5.67 mm; Weight: 10.83g\n\nDiscussion\n\nSimilar examples on the database include PAS-011055 (2016T920), SUR-F8960C (2025 T519), CORN-4C0618 (2024T214) and ESS-5DF4B7 (2023T513). These belong to a class of artefact which has been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980, Eogan 1994, 1997, Meeks et al 2008 and O&#39;Connor et al 2008).\n\nTheir function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196). The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.\n\nScientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This fits their type 3d: &lsquo;gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo;. Analysis of a similar example in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.\n\nThey have previously been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). They may well have a longer chronology within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC); This is now further supported by examples found with burials from Changis-sur-Marne, France, being radiocarbon dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1460-1290 cal BC) (Lafage et al. 2024, 339). As such a Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age date is appropriate c.1300-800 cal BC.\n\nReferences\n\nArmbruster, B.R. 2021.

The copper alloy has an even, well developed, dark green patina.\n\nThe object is 20.8mm long, 18.1mm wide and 8.5m thick. It weighs 10.35g.\n\nThe form of the piece is very similar to Bronze Age penannular rings whose precise function is unknown. They are often assumed to&nbsp;have been items of exchange and are frequently described as &#39;ring money&#39; because of this, though there is no proof this was the case. They may instead have been items of personal adornment or hair ornaments. Though few examples have been excavated from&nbsp;secure archaeological contexts, they are generally deemed to date from the middle - late Bronze Age (c. 1300-800 BC). They are usually composed of gold, or a bronze core plated with gold, but copper alloy examples have been recorded on the database, such as YORYM-9D0DD3, BH-70330D, BERK-30B91C and BH-8B4BED.

            "description": "A Late Bronze Age, gold, D-sectioned, penannular bar-bracelet, dating to c.1300-750&nbsp;BC.\n\nIt consists of&nbsp;a rectangular gold bar&nbsp;which is&nbsp;D-shaped in cross section. It has flared flat&nbsp;oval&nbsp;terminals, which would have been bent into a circular form to wrap around a wrist but is now distorted into a slight spiral shape.&nbsp;The surfaces are scratched and abraded, but otherwise undecorated and smoothly finished.\n\nIt measures:&nbsp;\n\nLength 61.3mm, Width 57.5mm, width of bar 5mm, thickness of bar 2.1mm and weight 19.8 grams.&nbsp;\n\nDiscussion: The bracelet has several parallels on the database. There are a number of examples&nbsp;consisting of a&nbsp;solid strip of gold with flared oval\/circular terminals, such as:&nbsp;WILT-830027 (2023T286),&nbsp;GLO-4998DD (2024T1300),&nbsp;WILT-81DC63 (2020T602) and&nbsp;CAM-21F97B (2017T867).&nbsp;Other similar examples are illustrated in Eogan (1994, p.176), from Ormingdale, Arran (no.1-4). These examples are all dated to between 1300 BC - 750 BC.&nbsp;Three other Bronze Age objects were found&nbsp;at the same rally, albeit different fields. The objects are a gold lock ring, spearhead and dagger. They are currently with the finders until a handover date can be arranged. Depending on their locations, this could be a potential hoard. HESH-2A1A85, recorded in 2006 was found 0.3km from the bracelet.\n\nConclusion:&nbsp;Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996\n\nReferences:\n\nEogan, G.

            "description": "A group of two gold objects, found in direct association (bead within ribbon), a ribbon ornament and bead of Bronze Age date (1300-1100 BC).\n\n\nDescription: A gold band or Ribbon probably from a Penannular ring of Middle to Late Bronze age date (1300-800 BC). The object is composed of a rectangular strip of gold, which is curved backward in an irregular fashion. &nbsp;The short edges of the object are slightly bevelled and unabraded. The upper surface is decorated with three embossed, repousse linear ribs, forming 2 grooves between, running along the long edges of the object. The strip is thin and the negative impressions of the ribs are visible on the reverse of the strip.&nbsp;\nDiscussion: &nbsp;Whilst the appearance of ribs may be paralleled on a number of gold strips and &#39;ribbons&#39; of known and very probable Bronze Age date including examples from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1980; Palmer 1980). The curve to these ribs is most similar to a number of penannular rings such as from the Granta Fen Hoard (British Museum Accession number: 1884,0520.3) and the Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011) both of which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material.&nbsp;\n\n\nFor similar tripartite rings&nbsp;on the PAS database see NMS-3A21E4 (2025 T187), HAMP-CAC0B5 (2022T509) WILT-788C7B (2019T253) and BERK-35E144 (2022T70).\n\n\nDescription: \n\nA gold, sheet, hollow annular bead of Middle Bronze Age date (1400-1100 BC). The object is circular in plan and biconical in profile. The object has a pronounced circumferential rib with minor post-depositional distortion to one portion of object. the centre of the object has a circular aperture measuring 4.88mm in diameter. &nbsp;\n\n\nDiscussion: \n\nThe bead is of similar form to several of sheet gold reported through the Treasure Act, namely HAMP-72E451 (2011 T526),GLO-46CA05 (2014 T358) and NMS-AEC678 (2013 T20) and notably the three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham hoard which are similar in form, size and weight (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts, including bronze palstaves, that allow it to be dated from c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid).\nThe bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005\/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).\nMiddle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. 2014) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called &#39;ornament horizon(s)&#39;, which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959, pp.151-155; Roberts 2007, pp.14-16).\n\n\nDimensions: &nbsp;\n1 Length: 16.13mm, Width: 9.35mm, Thickness (folded): 10.91mm, Thickness (strip): 0.96mm, Weight: 3.2g\n2 Diameter: 9.62mm, Diameter (aperture): 4.88mm, Height: 4.59mm, Thickness: 0.30mm, Weight: 0.2g\nConclusion: Both objects have parallels in known hoards and object associations (discussed above) and both may be dated at least in part to the Middle Bronze Age. As such the objects can be considered contemporary and being found in direct association are likely to represent a hoard of gold objects dating to the Middle Bronze Age. Each item individually appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and to be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\nReferences:\nGwilt, A (2004).

            "description": "A damaged and incomplete gold plated penannular ring of late Bronze Age date. The plating has been lost from one side revealing a copper alloy core. The surface is heavily worn and decorated&nbsp;with faint banding of an inlaid silver alloy. The terminals are flat and 4mm in diameter.",
            "notes": "A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This fits their type 3d: &lsquo;gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo;. Analysis of a similar example in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.\n\nThese penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC). They have variously been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Eogan 1994; 1997), but their function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196).&nbsp; The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.\n\nThey have previously been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). They may well have a longer chronology within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC); This is now further supported by examples found with burials from Changis-sur-Marne, France, being radiocarbon dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1460-1290 cal BC) (Lafage et al. 2024, 339). As such a Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age date is appropriate c.1300-800 cal BC.",

It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. &nbsp;The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.\n\nThey have previously been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal&nbsp;BC&nbsp;based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). They may well have a longer chronology within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC); however thus far this has been difficult to confirm as few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological context or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13).&nbsp;",

The strip is roughly rectangular but tapers along the long sides from the centre towards each terminal. The ends of the terminals have a slightly curved profile. One end of the ribbon is folded over and then folded back on itself. The ribbon is undecorated but is slightly twisted and is damaged by a small hole in the centre.\n\nDimensions: Length 43.4mm; Width 6.8mm (at centre tapering to 4.4mm); Thickness 0.5mm; Weight 2.75g.\n\nDiscussion: The object has few diagnostic features being made of a thin strip of gold. Gold bands are relatively undiagnostic component of (perhaps especially Middle and Later) Bronze Age goldwork in Southern England (c.1500-800 BC) (see Murgia et al. 2014a; Murgia et al. 2014b). There are similar examples previously recorded on the database that have been declared treasure from Dorset (2014T256), Wiltshire (2020T803), Warwickshire (2018T288), Surrey (2017T922) and Lancashire (2023 T750) which are suggested to be fragments from Bronze Age bracelets (e.g. 2009T435 and 2014T39). A further Bronze Age examples includes a gold securing strip, with perforated folded terminals, from a gold armlet or cuff found in the hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire, and illustrated in Savory (1980: 195, fig.47, no.1), which is now dated from the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC. A Bronze Age date is supported by those gold ribbons with more diagnostic features such as lateral ribs (see OXON-E7AB6A) due to an in-context example found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC. However, there are also examples which are suggested to come from the Roman to Early Medieval period (NLM-E8C60D, SWYOR-089827 and IOW-36803C).\n\nAs a result on the balance of probabilities this band can also be assigned to the Bronze Age, although a more precise date within the period is difficult to ascertain.\n\nConclusion: The object appears to have a composition of more than 10% precious metal and is probably at least 300 years old; it therefore meets the criteria for consideration as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\nAlyson Tanner, Finds Liaison Assistant for Wiltshire, Portable Antiquities Scheme\n\nWith contributions from Dr Edward Caswell, Finds Liaison Officer, Oxfordshire\n\nReferences:\n\nSavory, H.N.

The outer surface of the sheet is decorated by a series parallel ridge and grooves running along its length. The interior surface appears flat. \n\nIt is not possible to determine if the object is complete or cut down though the latter is likely. \n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 14mm; Width: 8.5mm; Thickness: 0.2mm; Weight: 0.6g.\n\nDiscussion: \n\nSimilar objects have been recorded as 2019 T316 (LEIC-47D0C2), 2018 T650 (HAMP-F792A5), 2010 T664 (LVPL-83FE92) and 2013 T471 (WMID-3CBCF0). Similar multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48). An in-context example has been found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC.\n\nSimilar narrow embossed strips are also illustrated by Taylor (1980, fig 28a-f) which are suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age. 2017 T882 (SOM-62CE08) states that several similar pieces have also been found bent into cylindrical beads (citing Elu&egrave;re 1982, 30, fig 25, no. 3) and it is unclear if this was their original purpose or if this was a common reuse for parts of larger ribbon ornaments. That this would not have been a regular cylinder might suggest this example was not used as a bead.\n\nConclusion: \n\nIn terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\nReferences:\n\nElu&egrave;re, C.

            "description": "Description: Bronze Age gold penannular ring with striped surface, almost circular in shape. It is sub-rectangular or sub-oval in cross-section, with wider, flattish inner and outer faces, and narrower, more curved faces on the front and back. It flares very slightly from the terminals to the centre. The surface&nbsp;is a polished gold, with&nbsp;ten widely and irregularly set oblique lines of a different material on each face, formed from an inlaid continuous spiral. The centre of these lines is golden brown,&nbsp;pitted and corroded in many places, and of inconsistent width, sometimes spreadlng&nbsp;out and then narrowing again. They are&nbsp;flanked by narrow silvery lines which fade into the gold background, but which can be seen to also curve out and in again around the spread-out edges, as if a&nbsp;sandwich of lines had been inlaid by being&nbsp;hammered into place; alternatively, the centre of the bands has corroded differently to the edges.\n\nThe terminals are&nbsp;almost parallel and facing each other. They are separated by a gap of c. 2.0-2.5mm, narrowest on the inside of the ring and slightly wider on the outside. They are broadly flat, but in the centre of each one is a short slot-like indentation parallel to the long axis of the cross-section, so running from front to back of the ring. This is again not gold, and appears to be where the inlaid spiral starts and finishes;&nbsp;on one terminal it can be seen apparently running through a groove in the gold.\n\nDimensions: When held with terminals uppermost, width 16.5mm, length perpendicular to this 15.3mm, thickness 5.2mm. The cross-section of the ring varies from 4.2 x 5.2mm at the terminals to 5.0 x 5.2mm at the centre. It&nbsp;weighs 10.50g.\n\nDiscussion:&nbsp;Penannular rings are fairly common finds;&nbsp;around 150 have been&nbsp;recorded on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database, with at least as many having been discovered before the advent of the Scheme (Meeks et al. 2008, 13). Despite this, their function remains mysterious.\n\nMany of the PAS-recorded examples are from central southern England, but fifteen,&nbsp;including this example, come from Norfolk, with eleven&nbsp;having a&nbsp;banded or striped surface. One, from Hockwold-cum-Wilton (BM-377122, 2003T6) has a similar appearance to this one, with the centre of the inlaid stripes appearing dark and corroded, but the edges staying silvery.\n\nIt is hard to tell the material of the inlay from&nbsp;visual inspection alone, although where they have been analysed the inlays are of electrum (a naturally occurring silvery gold). The variable colour and differential corrosion is not easy&nbsp;to explain.\n\nThey have until recently been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal&nbsp;BC, based firstly on burials in Belgium, north-east France and the Netherlands, and secondly on&nbsp;Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13).\n\nGwilt suggests, in discussion of an example recorded at&nbsp;NMGW-04216C&nbsp;(citing Raftery&nbsp;in Roche et al 2004, 87-8) that&nbsp;in recent years&nbsp;the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing,&nbsp;to the extent that these items may now be placed within a wider date-range encompassing the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800&nbsp;BC).\n\nDate:&nbsp;Middle to Late Bronze Age, 1300-800&nbsp;BC.",
