It is circular in cross-section and 5.11mm thick with a small gap to one side. There are a few small cracks on each surface revealing the copper-alloy core within and in places patches of copper-alloy corrosion have accumulated.Date: c.1300-c.800&nbsp;BC.Dimensions: Diameter: 15.97mm, thickness: 5.11mm, weight: 9.21gDiscussion: Gold and gold-on-base-metal rings of this type, including penannular forms, are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1300&ndash;c.800 BC). &nbsp;Although variously termed &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; or &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; in the literature (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al. 2008; O&rsquo;Connor et al. 2008) their function remains unresolved (see Armbruster 2021, 191&ndash;196). Current consensus increasingly favours interpretation as items of personal adornment, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than as hair ornaments or units of exchange.Interpretation is, however, hampered by the fact that relatively few examples derive from secure archaeological contexts. Burial assemblages from Belgium, north-east France and the Netherlands, alongside Scottish and Irish hoard associations, suggest a floruit during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;c.800 BC) (Eogan 1997). However, growing evidence indicates an earlier origin and a longer period of manufacture and circulation than previously assumed (Raftery 2004, 87&ndash;88). Two examples from Scotland were recovered from a hoard and a cave site respectively, both associated with Late Bronze Age sequences dating to c.1150&ndash;c.800 BC. Although, given the predominantly southern English distribution of such rings, it is possible that their introduction occurred slightly earlier (Eogan 1997). On comparative stylistic grounds, the present example is therefore best dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (c.1300&ndash;c.800 BC).The object contains more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Bibliography Armbruster, B. R. 2021.

This bar has been bent into an approximately circular loop with a small gap (2-3mm) between the two terminals.The ring is mostly covered in a pale matte green-grey corrosion layer, which has fine pitting throughout, and is more brown in colour on the interior face of the ring. There are no traces of gold remaining on the surface, suggesting that perhaps this is an unfinished object that was never gold-plated.The ring has a maximum outer diameter of 20.93mm, maximum inner diameter of 11.01mm, and a thickness of 5.61mm. It weighs 4.24 grams.A close parallel is recorded on the PAS database under NMS-97017C.

This pattern appears to be created by inlaying a continuous strip of silvery gold around the core, giving the impression of alternating bands of gold and silver. The entire copper alloy core is gold-plated, though there is some damage at the terminals that reveals&nbsp;the underlying copper core. The tapering of the stripes towards the centre suggests that the ring was bent into shape after the silver wire was inlaid.&nbsp;MeasurementsDiameter: 17.80 mm; Thickness: 5.81 mm; Width: 5.67 mm; Weight: 10.83gDiscussionSimilar examples on the database include PAS-011055 (2016T920), SUR-F8960C (2025 T519), CORN-4C0618 (2024T214) and ESS-5DF4B7 (2023T513). These belong to a class of artefact which has been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980, Eogan 1994, 1997, Meeks et al 2008 and O&#39;Connor et al 2008).Their function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196). The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.Scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This fits their type 3d: &lsquo;gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo;. Analysis of a similar example in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.They have previously been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997).

The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts, including bronze palstaves, that allow it to be dated from c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid).The bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. 2014) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called &#39;ornament horizon(s)&#39;, which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959, pp.151-155; Roberts 2007, pp.14-16).Dimensions: &nbsp;1 Length: 16.13mm, Width: 9.35mm, Thickness (folded): 10.91mm, Thickness (strip): 0.96mm, Weight: 3.2g2 Diameter: 9.62mm, Diameter (aperture): 4.88mm, Height: 4.59mm, Thickness: 0.30mm, Weight: 0.2gConclusion: Both objects have parallels in known hoards and object associations (discussed above) and both may be dated at least in part to the Middle Bronze Age. As such the objects can be considered contemporary and being found in direct association are likely to represent a hoard of gold objects dating to the Middle Bronze Age. Each item individually appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and to be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.References:Gwilt, A (2004).

Small penannular ring RF&lt;1&gt;: &nbsp;A small penannular ring of gold foil over a copper alloy core, decorated with six rows of punched dots, conforming to type 3.7.8: gold plated metal core with punched decoration (Murgia et al 2014; Meeks et al 2008). The ring is of a similar diameter around the circumference, tapering to a rounded point at both terminals, where the gold foil can be seen to be folded and smoothed over the ends (Fig.1 and 2). The cross- section of the ring appears heptagonal rather than circular, and the inner facet is not punched with dots. One terminal exhibits a slight thickening of the diameter before tapering again, giving the impression of an animal-like head at that end of the ring. It is not clear whether this is intentional; the dot pattern is distorted by the thickened area but does not deviate from its intended path. A slight split in the gold foil casing can be observed where the core thickens, and although this does not appear to be as a result of corrosion within the core, the x-radiograph (Fig.3) does show losses to the core at this terminal in particular. The gold foil appears to have been applied to the core before bending; visual inspection under a hand lens of x40 magnification rendered the seam visible as a very faint line along the interior surface, broken by two areas of vertical folding which have been annealed or burnished flat. It is uncertain at which stage in the process the punched decoration was applied, either before or after the application of the gold to the core or before or after the ring was bent into shape; any distortion in the form of the dots which might be expected from them being applied before the ring was bent seems to be absent, other than over the thickened area at the terminal where the dots are noticeably shallower than those to either side.Small penannular ring RF&lt;2&gt;: A small section of gold foil from the exterior of a penannular ring (Fig.4 and 5). The surface of the metal is dull and pitted. This is perhaps due to the composition of the gold alloy used in manufacturing this object, which differs from that of the gold utilised in the complete ring (see discussion below). The foil appears to have been wrapped around a base metal core which has corroded away, now forming a hollow, curving, tube which tapers slightly towards the terminal. Both ends are open. It is not clear whether the fragment was originally decorated.Dimensions: Penannular ring RF&lt;1&gt; has an external diameter of 10.1mm and is 2.1mm in diameter at the midpoint of the hoop body. The ring is of a similar diameter around the circumference, tapering to a rounded point at both terminals, however, one terminal exhibits a slight thickening of the diameter, to c.2.2mm, before tapering again, giving the impression of an animal-like head at that end of the ring. The gap between the terminals is c.0.5mm. Weight 0.66gPenannular ring RF&lt;2&gt; measures c.6mm in length and 2mm in diameter. Weight &lt;0.1gDating: The cremation from which the penannular rings were excavated was one of a group of five unurned cremations which formed a discrete collection of features unrelated to the later Saxon and medieval features encountered across the wider excavation. Due to bone fragment size, it is thought to have contained the remains of a juvenile or adult individual, however no sexually diagnostic material was present.&nbsp; Radiocarbon determinations on cremated human bone (Beta-751303) and Corylus avellana charcoal (Beta-751304) from the cremation, are statistically inconsistent at the 5% significance level (T=9.4; v=1; T&rsquo;(5%)= 3.8; Ward and Wilson 1978); and at the 1% significance level T=9.4; v=1; T&rsquo;(1%)= 6.6; ibid.). It is therefore likely that the cremated bone and charcoal are of different ages. The later/younger measurement of 2850&plusmn;30 BP (Beta-751303); 1120-920 cal BC (95% probability), on the cremated bone probably provides the best estimate for the context. It is possible that the older date of 2990&plusmn;30 BP (Beta-751304); 1380-1120 cal BC (95% probability) on the hazel (Corylus avellana) charcoal is due to the wood having a built-in age-at-death which produces an age-offset referred to as the &lsquo;old wood effect&rsquo;. Unfortunately, the original size and maturity of the hazel charcoal could not be determined and although hazel is generally considered a small, &lsquo;short&rsquo;-lived tree, living for around 80 years, it can reach greater maturity especially when managed (Allott 2025). This date range is consistent with the broad dating of penannular rings which are characteristic of the Middle to Late Bronze Age, and is noteworthy due to the comparative lack of stratified, well dated examples (Meeks et al 2008, 13). In recent years, the dating of these smaller rings has been subject to revision and the C14 dating in this case is consistent with both British, Irish and continental examples (Becker et al 2020, 120-2; Warmenbol 2021).Analytical results: Portable XRF analysis of the rings&rsquo; surface was carried out by Victoria Lucas at the Institute of Archaeology, UCL (Table 1). Both rings are made from gold, alloyed with silver and copper, with a lower gold content than some previously studied examples (e.g.Meeks et al 2008, 15). The results for Ring RF &lt;1&gt; are superficially consistent in gold content with a group of small rings from Sculptors cave (Becker et al 2020, 122 Table 5.13). &nbsp;There is a consistency in the amount of silver within the alloys of both rings, however the percentage of copper present in Ring RF&lt;2&gt; exceeds that of comparable examples, recording a much lower percentage of gold, with a much correspondingly higher percentage of copper.&nbsp; This may be a true reflection of the composition of the gold alloy used to produce the foil, or the result of the pXRF picking up the remnants of a copper or copper alloy core (c.f. Warner 2014); if the former, the higher copper percentage may account for the comparatively poorer preservation of Ring RF&lt;2&gt; (V. Lucas pers comm). Further quantitative analysis from subsurface samples would be required to ascertain the true metal composition.

There is considerable variation in size, decoration and composition across the known examples of penannular rings, which perhaps argues for variation in their use (Becker et al 2020, 122).&nbsp;&nbsp; Decoration in the form of punched dots and/ or incised lines are less frequently encountered than undecorated rings or, in the larger penannulars, those with striped decoration.&nbsp; A small number of rings in the British Museum collections share characteristics of the current example: a plated ring with punched and incised decoration and copper alloy core from Ireland is perhaps of similar construction (BM 1869,0923.1), as is an example with a white metal core (Meeks et al 2008 fig.1 xvii; BM 1965,0606.1), both of which are much larger than the current examples. Another Irish ring, of solid gold with punched dot decoration (BM 1862,0617.2) is a close parallel in terms of size and decoration. &nbsp;More recently, a small solid gold penannular ring from Kent with punched dot and incised line decoration was recorded via the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS-5607C5; 2005 T282) and a similarly sized ring with incised chevron decoration was recovered from an un-urned Middle Bronze Age cremation in Wales (Gilbert et al 2024; PAS ID NMGW-615AC8), which also contained a burnt wooden comb. Closer geographically to the current site, cremation (344), one of the small number of&nbsp; Deverel -Rimbury cremations at North Ring, Mucking (Bond 1988, 14 and Fig.13) produced two gold foil over tin core rings of similar morphology; Northover (2000, 302) dates this method of construction to the Penard Phase, i.e. 13-12th centuries BC, pre-dating the various other forms of penannular ring which are associated with the Ewart Park phase (ibid.). &nbsp;Of the European examples cited by Eogan (1997, figure 2), the majority were found in cremation burials, including two from the same burial at Villneuve-saint-Germain, France which appear to be of similar size and morphology to ring &lt;2&gt; (ibid.). In France, burials are fairly poorly furnished, containing one or two rings, in contrast with the Low Countries, where burials are more richly furnished with other artefacts alongside penannular rings; an association with cremated human remains prevails, as well as some recovered, as at Sculpter&rsquo;s Cove, with inhumations, and also within caves (Warmenbol 2021).These objects contain a minimum of 10% precious metal and are over 300 years old. Consequently, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content, and as part of the same find.References Allott, L in prep Radiocarbon dating in Dyson, A et al Archaeological Mitigation, Land off Ellen Aldous Avenue (Phase 2b) ASE report no.2025149Armit, I and B&uuml;ster, L 2020 Darkness Visible: The Sculptor&rsquo;s Cave, Covesea, from the Bronze Age to the Picts.

One end of the ribbon is folded over and then folded back on itself. The ribbon is undecorated but is slightly twisted and is damaged by a small hole in the centre.Dimensions: Length 43.4mm; Width 6.8mm (at centre tapering to 4.4mm); Thickness 0.5mm; Weight 2.75g.Discussion: The object has few diagnostic features being made of a thin strip of gold. Gold bands are relatively undiagnostic component of (perhaps especially Middle and Later) Bronze Age goldwork in Southern England (c.1500-800 BC) (see Murgia et al. 2014a; Murgia et al. 2014b). There are similar examples previously recorded on the database that have been declared treasure from Dorset (2014T256), Wiltshire (2020T803), Warwickshire (2018T288), Surrey (2017T922) and Lancashire (2023 T750) which are suggested to be fragments from Bronze Age bracelets (e.g. 2009T435 and 2014T39). A further Bronze Age examples includes a gold securing strip, with perforated folded terminals, from a gold armlet or cuff found in the hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire, and illustrated in Savory (1980: 195, fig.47, no.1), which is now dated from the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC. A Bronze Age date is supported by those gold ribbons with more diagnostic features such as lateral ribs (see OXON-E7AB6A) due to an in-context example found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC. However, there are also examples which are suggested to come from the Roman to Early Medieval period (NLM-E8C60D, SWYOR-089827 and IOW-36803C).As a result on the balance of probabilities this band can also be assigned to the Bronze Age, although a more precise date within the period is difficult to ascertain.Conclusion: The object appears to have a composition of more than 10% precious metal and is probably at least 300 years old; it therefore meets the criteria for consideration as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.Alyson Tanner, Finds Liaison Assistant for Wiltshire, Portable Antiquities SchemeWith contributions from Dr Edward Caswell, Finds Liaison Officer, OxfordshireReferences:Savory, H.N.

It is sub-rectangular or sub-oval in cross-section, with wider, flattish inner and outer faces, and narrower, more curved faces on the front and back. It flares very slightly from the terminals to the centre. The surface&nbsp;is a polished gold, with&nbsp;ten widely and irregularly set oblique lines of a different material on each face, formed from an inlaid continuous spiral. The centre of these lines is golden brown,&nbsp;pitted and corroded in many places, and of inconsistent width, sometimes spreadlng&nbsp;out and then narrowing again. They are&nbsp;flanked by narrow silvery lines which fade into the gold background, but which can be seen to also curve out and in again around the spread-out edges, as if a&nbsp;sandwich of lines had been inlaid by being&nbsp;hammered into place; alternatively, the centre of the bands has corroded differently to the edges.The terminals are&nbsp;almost parallel and facing each other. They are separated by a gap of c. 2.0-2.5mm, narrowest on the inside of the ring and slightly wider on the outside. They are broadly flat, but in the centre of each one is a short slot-like indentation parallel to the long axis of the cross-section, so running from front to back of the ring. This is again not gold, and appears to be where the inlaid spiral starts and finishes;&nbsp;on one terminal it can be seen apparently running through a groove in the gold.Dimensions: When held with terminals uppermost, width 16.5mm, length perpendicular to this 15.3mm, thickness 5.2mm. The cross-section of the ring varies from 4.2 x 5.2mm at the terminals to 5.0 x 5.2mm at the centre.

Despite this, their function remains mysterious.Many of the PAS-recorded examples are from central southern England, but fifteen,&nbsp;including this example, come from Norfolk, with eleven&nbsp;having a&nbsp;banded or striped surface. One, from Hockwold-cum-Wilton (BM-377122, 2003T6) has a similar appearance to this one, with the centre of the inlaid stripes appearing dark and corroded, but the edges staying silvery.It is hard to tell the material of the inlay from&nbsp;visual inspection alone, although where they have been analysed the inlays are of electrum (a naturally occurring silvery gold). The variable colour and differential corrosion is not easy&nbsp;to explain.They have until recently been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal&nbsp;BC, based firstly on burials in Belgium, north-east France and the Netherlands, and secondly on&nbsp;Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13).Gwilt suggests, in discussion of an example recorded at&nbsp;NMGW-04216C&nbsp;(citing Raftery&nbsp;in Roche et al 2004, 87-8) that&nbsp;in recent years&nbsp;the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing,&nbsp;to the extent that these items may now be placed within a wider date-range encompassing the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800&nbsp;BC).Date:&nbsp;Middle to Late Bronze Age, 1300-800&nbsp;BC.",1,,"As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-25T00:00:00Z,2024-10-25T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,"South Norfolk","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1315249,images/awilliamsnorfolk/,NMS-433163_67a0d7fcb16e5.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2024-12-19T14:52:06Z,2025-09-30T09:13:53Z

DENO-EB8F48 (2021 T465) notes that these types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300 - 800 BC). Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating, though burials in Belgium, north-east France, and The Netherlands, in addition to Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 BC (Eogan 1997). In recent years however, evidence for earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, this penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC).This object contains precious metal and is over 300 years old, therefore it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.References:Eogan, G. 1997. &lsquo;Hair-rings&rsquo; and European Late Bronze Age society.

The body of the bracelet is solid, with curving sides that crate a squished penannular loop. The base and sides of the loop have an even thickness of 5mm high and 3mm wide. However, both ends are expanded to form trumpet terminals that are 6.5mm high and 6mm wide. Smith (2023) records that gold penannular bracelet is characteristic of British Bronze Age ornamentation. Typically, gold bars were a feature in their manufacture, such that the majority, like this example, have solid bodies and termini, and decoration was not common in Britain (Eogan, 1994, p84-5).Particularly similar examples with square cross sections and slightly expanded terminals include examples from the from Sporle with Palgrave hoard (Taylor 1988: EA86), Morvah Hoard (Pearce 1983: case 108) and an example from the British Museum Collections from Towednack, Cornwall (Accession number 1932,0511.7 f). This is described as a gold bar which may have been an unfinished bracelet, dating to c. 1400-1100 BC.Other similar, complete bracelets have been found as part of hoards at Beachy Head, Sussex (Eogan, 1994, Plate 10, p170) and at Stonehill, Lanark (Eogan, 1994, Plate 15, p175).

A Bronze Age date is supported by those gold ribbons with more diagnostic features such as lateral ribs (see OXON-E7AB6A) due to an in-context example found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC.

Both terminals are tapered suggesting they have been cut. Overall, the artefact has a sub-oval plan. The surface is smooth and gold with some small nicks and dents. Dimensions: Height: 4.6 mm; Thickness: 1.58 mm; Weight: 1.05 g; Diameter: 6.73 mm.Discussion: Single finds of gold coiled rings are usually assigned Middle Bronze Age dates based on comparable examples found in hoards with other dateable artefacts. The Fittleworth Hoard (BM 1996, 0902.18) from West Sussex contains two, admittedly slightly larger, coiled rings together with a range of other Middle Bronze Age gold artefacts. Similarly, 2023-T1094 (LANCUM-D7E08D) comprises a gold bracelet or armlet with five closed penannular rings of a similar size and form and has been assigned a Middle Bronze Age date based on the size form of the twisted wire bracelet.

Those which are D-shaped and&nbsp;flat on the inside, like the example recorded here, are less&nbsp;common, but examples which&nbsp;have also been submitted for the consideration as Treasure include&nbsp;OXON-B69005&nbsp;(2022T1110);&nbsp;ESS-9DB6CE (2020T1020), both fragments.

Other examples of multi-strand penannular&nbsp;rings, including those of circular and C-shaped section have been found as part of hoards dated to the Middle Bronze Age. The Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745 &ndash; Welsh Treasure case 04:02)&nbsp;includes a composite gold penannular ring formed from three round-sectioned wires which have been fused together, with simple clipped or cut terminals. The Cirencester Hoard (BM-28B710 &ndash; 2004 T416) includes two double penannular rings and a fragment of a third. Finally, the Granta Fen hoard (British Museum Accession No. 1884,0520) includes several multistranded penannular rings looped around a gold bracelet which was found with an incomplete rapier.

This has created a straight side edge for the first 3/4, the final 1/4 has a slight lip suggesting that the initial cut was not deep enough to sever it completely, making it necessary to finish the process by bending and snapping the object in two. There is a thick scar that runs along the top edge of the penannular showing that a second ring would have been attached above. See LIN-B62849 (2024 T476) for a complete example. Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores (See Green 1988 or&nbsp;Ashby 2007 for examples) but this not the case with this example as the cut has clearly exposing the core of the artefact. Discussion: &nbsp;Dr Edward Caswell discusses a similar ring record at GLO-A9AD4A (2018T98) where he writes. Penannular rings belong to a class of artefact which have in the past been given various terms such as &#39;hair-rings&#39; (Eogan 1997) and other monikers such as &lsquo;Ring Money&rsquo; (Geen 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65 Varndell 2001). Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.They are given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008,&nbsp; 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing&nbsp;Raftery 2004, 87-8)&nbsp;that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores (See Green 1988 or&nbsp;Ashby 2007 for examples) but this not the case with this example as the cut has clearly exposing &nbsp;the core of the artefact.

There is dried soil adhering to many surfaces, with powdery green surfaces on upper flange, butt and stop, also extending in patches down the blade surfaces and sides. There are traces of blackening on one upper septum surface near the butt-end. 3. Transitional palstave Surviving length 170.0mm, blade width 39.6mm, butt width 22.2mm, body width below loop 25.9mm, length of butt (to stop) approx. 68.8mm, maximum thickness at stop 29.1mm, stop heights 8.5 &amp; 9.5mm; Weight: 422.2g (after cleaning, prior to conservation)This is a virtually complete bronze looped palstave with a narrow blade. The upper sides have a very slight concavity, then becoming straight along mid and lower sections and divergent to an unexpanded edge. There is slight waisting below the stop, with a slight widening convexity of butt sides above the stop. A single medial ridge extends about one half of the way down each blade surface. The hafting slot is sub-rectangular, while the septum floor is slightly concave in cross-section. The stop is slightly protuberant in side-section, while the flanges are relatively straight. In side view the stop levels are misaligned, while the casting seam is off-centre, indicating a mismatching of mould parts in the casting of the palstave. The butt is sub-rounded, though slightly asymmetric in plan view and the loop is complete and narrow in side-section. The palstave has been cleaned, probably in water, since discovery by the temporary holder and before the palstave was recalled to the National Museum as possible treasure. This has resulted in differential surface decay of this palstave, with large areas of light powdery corrosion with pits and warts. In addition the blade end is very unstable, with blade edge fragments having broken off, since initial PAS recording and photography, but before the axe entered the National Museum. 4. Transitional palstave Surviving length 163.0mm, blade width 41.4mm, butt width 22.9mm, body width below loop 26.6mm, length of butt (to stop) approx. 65.9mm, maximum thickness at stop 28.5mm, stop heights 8.5 &amp; 8.5mm; Weight: 410.4g (prior to cleaning)This is a complete bronze looped palstave with a narrow blade, whose sides are very slightly concave and divergent to an unexpanded edge. There is slight waisting below the stop, with a slight widening convexity of butt sides above the stop. A single medial ridge extends about one third of the way down each blade surface. The hafting slot is sub-angular, while the septum floor is slightly concave in cross-section. The flanges are relatively straight. In side view the stop levels are misaligned, while the casting seam is off-centre, indicating a mismatching of mould parts in the casting of the palstave. The butt is square ended and the loop is complete and relatively narrow in side-section. There is dried mud adhering to many surfaces, though with surviving original surfaces with grey-green patination also showing through. The flange tops and loop side have light green powdery and unstable surfaces. The blade edge is also very unstable with small fragments having detached since discovery and with light green powdery surfaces. On one mid blade face, there are modern gouged nicks and similarly on the opposite upper blade face, there are recent surface scars. Each has small patches of light green powdery surface around them. 5. Transitional palstave Surviving length 165.0mm, blade width 39.2mm, butt width 21.9mm, body width below loop 26.0mm, length of butt (to stop) approx. 64.5mm, maximum thickness at stop 29.8mm, stop heights 9.0 &amp; 9.5mm; Weight: 424.6g (prior to cleaning)This is a virtually complete bronze looped palstave with a narrow blade. The upper sides have a very slight concavity, then becoming straight along mid and lower sections and divergent to an unexpanded edge. There is slight waisting below the stop, with a slight widening convexity of butt sides above the stop. A single medial ridge extends around half way down each blade surface. The hafting slot is sub-rectangular, while the septum floor is slightly concave in cross-section. The stop is slightly protuberant in side section, while the flanges are relatively straight. In side view the stop levels are misaligned, while the casting seam is off-centre, indicating a mismatching of mould parts in the casting of the palstave. The butt is heavily worn, but sub-rounded in plan view and the loop is complete and narrow in side-section. There is dried mud adhering to some surfaces, however a reasonable proportion of original srfaces survive with a grey-green coloured patination. On the sides, flange tops, butt end and blade end, there are light green areas of unstable powdery surface, with some pitting and &lsquo;warts&rsquo;. 6. Possible casting jet (PAS ref. CPAT-53DDB6)Length 27.6mm, diameter of top surface 24.6mm, length near base 13.4mm, width near base 8.2mm; Weight 35.9g. This deliberately shaped copper alloy fragment has a near circular top-surface, which is convex in profile. The sides are concave, tapering to a narrower base, which is rounded, though oval in plan view. There is no evidence remaining of one or two runner-stubs, the base surface being worn. Though deliberately shaped, the surfaces of this fragment have irregularities, small projections and depressions, consistent with being a bi-product rather than an artefact. The fragment has a grey green patination. The five palstaves show a remarkable degree of similarity with each other, which manifests itself in their stylistic and chronological similarity, weight and dimensional similarities and specific visual similarities in their shape as cast in the mould. These observations are pertinent in assessing the likelihood of their being found at five different single find locations, as reported by the finder, or alternatively as a hoard of five artefacts buried together in one place, as argued&nbsp;by the lead author&nbsp;(AG). All five palstaves may be identified as Transitional palstaves of Type Shelf and Midribbed Variant (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 146-8 &amp; Cats. 846-874). In other words they all have narrow unexpanded blades, similar proportions and a medial ridge extending from the stop down each upper blade face. They may all be similarly dated to between 1350-1050BC during the Middle Bronze Age and early part of the Late Bronze Age. The degree of similarity is heightened further by virtue of a comparison of weights and dimensions, as tabulated and grouped below. Two close sub-groups may be identified. Palstaves 1, 2 &amp; 4 are remarkably similar and Palstaves 3 &amp; 5 form a second apparent sub-grouping. Here it is worth qualifying that Palstave 1 has an eroded butt end, therefore was originally a little wider when cast. In addition, Palstave 5 has a particularly worn butt end, which has resulted in a loss in overall length and a reduction in its butt length relative to Palstave 3, however all other measurements are closely similar. These observations may be further heightened by shape characteristics, which suggest that these palstaves may be mould linked: in other words that certain palstaves were cast in the same mould:-Palstaves 1 &amp; 2 (and possibly 4)Palstaves 1 &amp; 2 both have a squared butt end and a very similar form with straight slightly divergent sides and no expansion of the blade. The blade ends are flat. The mid-ridges on the upper faces are exactly alike and extend down the upper third of the blade faces. In side view, both axes share exactly the same shape of casting seams and flange profiles. Both have the same and asymmetric mismatching of mould halves, to the extent that one mould side was deeper than the other. Moreover on the loop side, the stop levels are similarly mismatching, the left side having a lower and less pronounced stop. Though very similar in dimensions to Palstaves 1 &amp; 2, Palstave 4 is slightly shorter in length. Unlike Palstaves 1 &amp; 2, it has a very slightly expanded blade edge and the edge is markedly more rounded and crescent shaped than the other two. The different preparation of the blade and the more recent erosion and chipping along the blade edge may account for the noticeably shorter length of this artefact (amounting to 3-4mm). Palstave 4 shares a squared butt end and almost identical mid ridge definition as Palstaves 1 &amp; 2. In addition, a very similar shaped casting seam and asymmetry of mould pairing is seen, exactly the same as with Palstaves 1 &amp; 2. Therefore, while the degree of similarity is less &ndash; perhaps accounted for due to a difference in palstave blade preparation after casting &ndash; Palstave 4 could be suggested as possibly mould linked with Palstaves 1 &amp; 2. Palstaves 3 &amp; 5These palstaves share a sub-rounded butt end and a very similar form, with slight concavity on upper blades, with slight lower blade side convexity, coming to an unexpanded blade, giving a similar slightly bulbous or sinuous blade outline. The blade ends are both similarly rounded. On one face, the stops share exactly the same blemish, showing as a central depression in the stop and diminishing of the stop-height. The mid-ridge below each stop has a slight uneven bulbous and sinuous imperfection &ndash; very precisely matching imperfections strongly suggesting they were cast in the same mould. On the non-loop side, the casting seams have exactly the same asymmetry &ndash; left side shallower than right &ndash; with a projecting sinuosity immediately above the level of the stop in both instances. When the palstaves are placed with their loops to the right, then the upper non-loop face edges have the same waisting and definition, almost identical similarities further strongly suggesting they were cast in the same mould. Palstave 3 has experienced differentially higher erosion of its butt end since burial in the ground, accounting for noticeable differences in palstave length and butt length. Palstave 5 has been washed, possibly accounting for its lower weight, due to the removal of soil and also to consequential differential corrosion of the original surfaces. Transitional palstaves flourished during the Penard metalworking tradition of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC) and continued into the Wilburton tradition of the Late Bronze Age (1150-1000BC) (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 152-7; Northover unpublished 193-4 &amp; 212). The earliest examples were made towards the end of the Taunton / Cemmaes metalworking phase (1350-1275BC), being found in hoard associations with Group III low-flanged palstaves (e.g. Hawkes 1955; Burgess 1970; Rowlands 1976; Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 152-3; Gwilt et al unpublished). An overview of the occurrence of Transitional palstaves known in Wales indicates they are relatively uncommon in relation to the incidence of other more common palstave forms. There are only 39 examples known prior to the Nantmel five, bringing the total now known from Wales to 44. Of these, 31 are single finds, while a further 8 examples have been found in 6 different hoards (Northover unpublished; with recently reported PAS finds). These include hoards from Burton (Wrexham), Llantwit Major (Vale of Glamorgan), &lsquo;central Wales&rsquo;, Porthamel (Anglesey) and Monkton (Pembrokeshire) (Williams 1867, 283 &amp; Pl.; Laws 1908; Grimes 1933, 90-1 &amp; Fig. 2; Savory 1980,&nbsp; 117 &amp; 126, Cats. 265 &amp; 300, Figs. 23 &amp; 31,&nbsp; Pl. VIIa; Lynch 1991, 232 &amp; Fig. 63.10-11; Gwilt et al 2007; unpublished; Northover unpublished, Hoards 16, 144 &amp; 167). In neighbouring Shropshire and Cheshire, the Bryn Siop, Meol Brace and Wilmslow hoards also contain Transitional palstaves (Chitty, 1925; Davey &amp; Forster 1975, Cats 54-55 &amp; Figs.; Savory 1980, 106, Cat. 168 &amp; Fig. 22; Longley 1987, 103 &amp; Fig. 18.3; Northover unpublished Hoards 44,149 &amp; 160). However, the only known hoard containing Transitional palstaves from Powys (two examples of the different Type Roundhay, Midribbed Variant form) is the Ffynhonnau hoard (Banks 1884; Savory 1955, 102 &amp; Pl. VI; 1958, 27-8 &amp; Fig. 3; Northover unpublished, Hoard 19). To the knowledge of the author, no single finds of Transitional palstaves have previously been reported from Powys, prior to these five discoveries from Nantmel. Seen in this context, the discovery of five reportedly single finds of the same form of Type Shelf, Midribbed Variant, Transitional palstaves, specifically from the Nantmel locality, discovered at around the same time and by the same finder would be a truly remarkable and unparalleled coincidence. In the opinion of the author (AG), a much more likely probability is that the five closely similar palstaves were in fact buried and found as an associated hoard group in one location, contrary to the reported account of the discovery given by the finder. The issue of whether or not the possible casting jet was buried with the five palstaves is more difficult to ascertain from the available evidence. In form, casting jets are not always chronologically diagnostic, therefore there may be little to differentiate a jet of Middle Bronze Age date from one of Late Bronze Age date. In general, casting jets are most commonly found within Late Bronze Age hoards spanning the period 1150-800BC and slightly later than these palstaves. Casting jets are rare in Middle Bronze Age hoards, however not unknown. A Middle Bronze Age palstave with a casting jet was recently discovered and reported as treasure from Ottery St. Mary, Devon (Worrell 2008), while probable eroded jets were associated with the maritime metalwork assemblage from Langdon Bay, off the coast of Kent (Muckelroy 1981; Stuart Needham pers. comm.). This latter assemblage probably relates to a shipwreck site, but dates to the same Penard metalworking tradition of the Middle Bronze Age as the five Nantmel palstaves (1300-1150BC). Surface metallurgical analysis of the possible jet has confirmed it is made of a leaded tin bronze. If viewed on its own and compared with other analysed artefacts, this would tend to be viewed as most consistent with a Late Bronze Age metal signature, though the possibility of another date of manufacture could not be discounted. However, similar and comparable analysis of the five Middle Bronze Age palstaves has indicated that all were also made of a leaded tin bronze. In particular, palstave 4 has a higher lead content, with a similar signature to the possible casting jet. Consequently, the possible jet, on the current evidence presented, could have been associated with the palstaves as part of the same hoard, however there is insufficient stylistic and compelling dating evidence to advise a balance of probability that it was. Therefore, one is forced to return to the coincidences relating to its discovery: the possible jet was found by the same finder as the palstaves, in the same reported vicinity and just a short time after the palstaves.&nbsp;The very similar metal compositions of palstaves 1, 2, 3 &amp; 5 are consistent with the assertion, on strong morphological grounds, that palstaves 1 &amp; 2 and palstaves 3 &amp; 5 were mould linked. This metallurgical evidence, based on surface and preliminary scan evidence, should however only be regarded as minor supporting evidence, rather than strong conclusive evidence in its own right. The higher level of lead in palstave 4 does not appreciably contrast in signature with the others and remains within the realm of possible variation seen within a contemporary, single hoard and mould linked group. Opinion &amp; recommendationIt is the primary author&rsquo;s opinion (AG), that the five palstaves here identified may be considered as treasure within the recently reviewed definition of treasure (Treasure Act 1996 and the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002). Contrary to the finder&rsquo;s account of discovery of the palstaves in five different localities, the close stylistic, morphological and casting characteristics exhibited by the palstaves provide strong grounds for suggesting the palstaves were found together as a hoard. Moreover, when seen within the broader context of discovery and reporting of Transitional palstaves in Powys and Wales to date, the discovery of five new examples in five different locations in the same vicinity, by the same finder and within a short space of time, can be regarded as unlikely and completely unparalleled. On a balance of probability, it is argued that the five palstaves were actually found directly associated together in the ground and that as contemporary prehistoric base-metal artefacts, buried together as a closed group they qualify under the current definition of treasure.

The blade flares from the stop ridge progressively, forming a crescent-shaped convex cutting edge. The blade tapers from the stop ridge to the blade edge, creating a wedge-shaped, triangular profile. On one face of the palstave, there is a depression in the shape of a shield; on the other face this is not apparent. The stop ridge is well developed on the side which bears the shield, with a rounded depression at the head of the septum. On the other face of the palstave, the septum is shallower and sub-rectangular in plan. The flanges are straight in plan and leaf-shaped in profile. The butt ascends from the stop ridge to the butt terminal. There is a casting ridge on both sides of the palstave. The palstave has a light-green patina and an uneven surface.Dimensions: The palstave measures 168 mm in length. The width at the blade edge is 67.28 mm, the thickness at the blade edge is 2.10 mm, the width at the stop is 25.97 mm, the thickness at the stop is 34.44 mm, the length of the socket is 67.81 mm. It weighs 522 g.Discussion: This form of palstave belongs to Rowlands (1976) Group 1 (or Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Class 1) primary shield type. It is comparable to Rowlands (1976) no. 699 (vol ii, plate 7), and Hoard 66, No. 1-6 (vol ii, plate 6). &nbsp;It dates to the Middle Bronze Age, between the Acton Park and Taunton phase, c. 1600-1200 cal. BC. (Ed Caswell, pers. comm.). Similar palstaves are recorded on the PAS database, such as WREX-9DC990, SUR-73F678, DENO-F6A145, and&nbsp;DOR-6ADAF9. *The palstave&nbsp;was originally submitted as part of a potential hoard&nbsp;along with a fragment of gold ribbon&nbsp;(DEV-BD02FA/2022T421).&nbsp;However,&nbsp;gold ribbons of this from are notable for having few in context discoveries and so few direct associations with contemporary items. The gold ribbon has been described by the finder having been &ldquo;found one foot away but a little deeper&rdquo;. A test pit has also been reported by the finder as having been dug in the area by archaeologists. The results of this excavation suggests that both were &ldquo;found in hill wash and were out of context, most probably through ploughing&rdquo;. Therefore, while the ribbon and the palstave were&nbsp;found suitably close to suggest they may have come from a single deposit their location in a disturbed hill wash context requires there to be good evidence why this might be the case rather than the items being buried over two separate events in the same region. While ribbons have been given broad dates, their only firm association has been with objects dating to the Early phase of the Bronze Age. The axehead meanwhile is of a type suggested most frequently to be found in isolation (Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or alternatively with material dating to the Middle Bronze Age. As these are not contemporary periods the ribbon, being an object of more than 10% precious metal over 300 years old qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 while the palstave does not on the balance of probability meet this threshold.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South West",Devon,"East Devon","Restricted access",Dunkeswell,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder",,1293558,images/bjw85/,DEV-ACB261_66eacb824f915.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,DEV,2024-09-18T13:44:22Z,2025-04-07T15:09:19Z

This is a complete annular gold band with parallel straight sides, now bent out of original shape with a current maximum external diameter of 26.7mm. If originally circular in shape, the band would have had a diameter of approximately 24 mm. The band has been constructed from five wires which have been fused and/or soldered together. The central wire and the pair of outer wires are of twisted S-spun form, later pressed flat when fused and possibly soldered together. The pair of wires located between the central and outer pair are plain and flat, possibly originally of round-section and pressed flat when fused together. The joins between each wire, now showing as three grooves on both upper and interior surfaces, were expertly made, with no gaps or tears evident around the circumference. The contours of the grooves and linear surface striations along them suggest that the joins were made and defined using a fine-pointed tool. A straight and fused transverse join is visible on one interior surface, showing as a linear groove, indicating the band was formed from an elongate strip, approximately 75mm long. In places, the joins between the twisted wires have failed, possibly as the band was bent out of its original shape, creating localized areas of detachment. Parallel striations are visible under the microscope along the band edges, suggesting tooling marks created by a file during the making process. The outer surface is more worn than the interior surface, where the wire twists are better defined. There are occasional scratches on the outer surface, probably created after the burial of the band or during its discovery and retrieval. The surfaces have a silvery- or white-gold patina, rather than an orange-gold patina more typical of gold containing a high copper content. The composite annular gold band finds technological and stylistic parallels with the twisted goldworking tradition spanning Atlantic Europe during the Penard metalworking tradition of the Middle Bronze Age (Bronze Final I in France) and dating from 1300-1150 BC (e.g. Taylor 1980, 60-4; Eogan 1994, 42-79; Roberts 2007). This period saw the widespread creation and use of twisted gold torcs and bracelets, often carefully deposited in hoards or as single objects. The twisted gold wire working technique, as illustrated through this composite band, finds close parallel with composite twisted gold wire bracelets, as known from the Burton hoard, Wrexham (Gwilt et al 2005; 2007) and the Salcombe Wreck, Devon (Needham et al 2013; Murgia et al 2014; British Museum Acc. Nos. 2010,8032.4 &amp; 2010,8032.7). The individual wire strands in these bracelets have been fused to each other at intervals, using early soldering technique. However, the weld and joins are discontinuous, in contrast to this annular band, where the weld is continuous. Further parallels in technique are found with composite gold penannular rings, comprising multiple plain wire strands fused together, another known artefact class linked with gold hoards of the Penard phase of the British Middle Bronze Age equating with Bronze Final I in France (e.g. Eogan 1967, 149-51; 1983, No. 28, Fig. 15E; Elu&egrave;re 1982, 26-7 &amp; 187; Gwilt et al 2004; Varndell 2007, 22-3 &amp; 229, Fig 6). However, the interleaving of plain with twisted wires, as apparent on this artefact and their fusing together into a composite ring, is an unusual variation which proves difficult to parallel. The apparent flattening of the external surfaces of the twisted wires on this ring, possibly created when the multiple wire strands were being fused together along their lengths, also hints at pressing or compression, possibly concurrently with the heating of the gold, perhaps to create the continuous weld. This is a novel aspect of this composite band, difficult to parallel elsewhere based on preliminary comparison. Most known composite rings are penannular in form with simple and flat-ended terminals. The continuous annular form of this composite band could suggest a different function. The current misshapen form of the ring makes it difficult to ascertain for certain whether it was originally circular or elongated and sub-rectangular with rounded corners. An original diameter of approximately 24 mm is large for it to have functioned as a finger ring, with more recent external finger ring diameters tending to be in the 16-22mm range. At 24mm diameter, if used as a ring, it is more likely to be in the thumb- or toe-ring range, or possibly worn over a glove. Were the band to demonstrate bending consistent with shaping around a narrow object, then it may have functioned as a decorative band around the hilt of a bronze dagger. Corrugated gold hilt bands are a feature of a small number of Early Bronze Age dagger burials, where they serve as pommel mounts (Henshall 1968, 173-195; Needham 2000, 52-54; Becker 2008, 75; Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 905 &amp; 914, Fig. 2; Noble &amp; Brophy 2011, 796-799, Fig. 8a). The lack of any tightly angled crease marks on this particular composite gold band tends to argue in favour of it probably once having been circular in shape and more likely to have functioned as a decorative ring.Similar annular gold rings have recently been reported from Ropley, Hampshire (Hinds 2015) and Takely, Essex (McLean 2007), however these were made of single coiled wires in spiral fashion, with weld joins between the twists. To these may be added examples of misshapen composite gold strips with wires welded or part welded to each other, where it is difficult to know whether the strips were originally annular or penannular in shape, with examples recently reported from Hepple, Northumberland (Collins 2009) and Prees, Shropshire (White 2022). In Wales, an example has recently been reported from St Ishmael Community, Carmarthenshire (Treasure Case 23.56), the subject of another ongoing treasure case not yet reported upon. Semi-quantitative surface XRF analysis of this composite annular band has indicated a mean gold content of 84.124%, silver content of 15.420% and copper content of 0.455%. This very low copper content is best paralleled with items of Early Bronze Age date in Wales, where a range of 0.3-1% copper is typical (Gwilt et al 2005, 36 &amp; Fig. 4). This initially appears at odds with the stylistic and technical parallels, which best fit with a Middle Bronze Age date. However, it is possible that there has been a surface depletion of copper on the gold band and only further drill sampling would establish whether the interior of the gold had a higher copper content than present on the surface. Also of interest is that recent metallurgical analysis of the gold twisted wire bracelet in the Burton, Wrexham hoard has produced a similar low copper composition of 0.91-1.01% sitting at the top end of the Early Bronze Age range (Davis 2018). Also, of probable Penard date, this hints that occasional gold artefacts were made using &lsquo;archaic&rsquo; low copper gold compositions during the Middle Bronze Age, possibly using gold deriving from different source locations. This is a matter for further future research and consideration. On balance, and on the basis of the evidence currently available, a probable Middle Bronze Age date for the composite gold ring is favoured.",1,,"ReferencesBecker, K. 2008.

This is a complete and small penannular ring of solid gold. The significant weight of the ring and the absence of any evidence for the detachment of foil indicates that the ring is of solid gold. Examination of the visible flat terminal surfaces under the microscope also confirm its solid gold composition, with no evidence of any folded over gold foil apparent. The even thickness of the ring, absence of internal compression ridges and its precisely circular shape are notable features. The upper and lower surfaces of the ring are slightly flattened, while the external diameter surface is generally rounded in profile. When viewed under the microscope numerous diagonal striations are visible across the outer surface, likely created when the ring was burnished in antiquity. On the external surface at the back of the ring is a small area of irregular pitting in the surface, probably an area of the original artefact form which escaped polishing and finishing before use. The internal ring surface appears relatively flat with rounded edge sections, giving the impression of a slightly D-shaped cross-section to the ring. Large areas of the internal surface, appear to have been smoothed, shiny and with parallel fine striations created either by polishing or during use. There is a slight and meandering faceting around the internal circumference, whose surface appears not to have been polished and is dull. The flat terminal ends are almost touching, separated by a narrow gap of between 0.2-0.5mm. Microscope examination of the terminal surfaces indicates the presence of parallel striations, consistent with fine file marks. There is some evidence that the ring has been gripped, possibly during its period of use or as working preparation prior to its burial. Two slightly flattened facets are visible on the external surface, one either side of the ring. The facet surfaces have damage striations on them. Another flattened facet is located across the external surfaces of the terminals. This shows more as a surface flattening and deformation of the outer terminal edges, so that they almost touch at their external margins. This penannular ring belongs to a group of artefacts which are commonly referred to as &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; or &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo;, dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages (1300-800 BC). This is the tenth known example of a hair-ring to be discovered from Wales and may be identified as of Type 1a &ndash; a plain, solid gold ring (Meeks et al 2008, 16-7, Fig. 1 i-iv). Only one other example of a hair-ring has previously been recorded from &lsquo;Carmarthenshire&rsquo;, a ring with a copper or copper alloy core with a plain gold foil surface, said to have been a metal-detector find before 1990 and offered for sale on the ebay website in August 2006. The only other hair-ring with a gold core from Wales is from Cwm Cadnant Community, Anglesey, which had a striped surface decoration, created by an inlayed spiral strip of silver-coloured electrum (Gwilt et al 2014). Hair-rings are far more common across other parts of Britain and Ireland, with 234 examples known from Ireland, 172 from England and 25 from Scotland (e.g. Becker et al 2020, 119-30 &amp; Table 5.12; Casaly 2021, 194).The sets of semi-quantitative analysis readings of the ring confirm that it is largely composed of gold, with some silver content and the deliberate addition of copper as a minor component. The surface copper composition at 3.2% is consistent with existing compositions derived from Middle Bronze Age gold artefacts from Wales, which are generally in the 2-6% ranges (Gwilt et al 2005, 34-6, Fig. 4; Gwilt &amp; Davis 2020, 357, Fig X.3). However, it is likely that the surface copper levels within this penannular ring have become differentially depleted through time, meaning that a possible Late Bronze Age date cannot be dismissed. Similar Late Bronze Age gold artefacts in Wales have been found to contain a range of 4-10% copper composition (Gwilt et al 2005, 34-6, Fig. 4; Gwilt &amp; Davis 2020, 357, Fig X.3). Further drill sampling and quantitative analysis of the internal composition of the gold would be required to determine an accurate copper content and in turn help date this penannular ring more accurately.",,,"PLEASE NOTE: This gold penannular ring is the subject of an&nbsp;ongoing piece of active research towards a wider publication.

A small semi-worked gold fragment of sub-rectangular shape, with one sub-rounded and hammered terminal and a snapped break with a fresh edge-surface at the opposite end. The fragment has near straight and flat sides with angular edges to the upper and lower surfaces and looks to have been hammered into its current shape. On the terminal end, a number of small, angular hammer facets are evident. On the upper and lower surfaces, approximately 2-3mm from the break, there is a slight raised ridging across the surfaces and near parallel with the break axis. This also corresponds with a kink or change of angle to both sides of the fragment and in the same parallel alignment, giving it a slightly bent profile in plan view. The fragment has a dull gold patina on hammered surfaces, the break edge also dull gold colour with a granular appearance across the crisp break. This gold fragment retains evidence for hammer flattening and shaping, indicating clearly that this is not a naturally occurring gold nugget and was partially worked and shaped by a gold-worker and subsequently probably deliberately bent and snapped. However, it is not possible to identify this with certainty to a class of finished gold artefact type of known period or date. The hammering and working technique observed on this fragment is consistent with observed Bronze Age working technology, however is not, in itself, diagnostic to a particular date. Semi-quantitative surface XRF analysis of the fragment has indicated an approximate composition of 78-9% gold, 15-16% silver and 5.3% copper. Copper was deliberately added to gold alloys in the Bronze Age, with the general trend for increasing proportions of copper with time, Late Bronze Age artefacts generally containing 4-10% copper and Early Bronze Age gold generally with less than 1% copper content (e.g. Hartmann 1980; Northover 1993, 517, Fig. 2). This copper component of approximately 5.3% is consistent with a Middle or Late Bronze Age signature, when compared with analyses of other Bronze Age gold artefacts from Wales (Gwilt et al 2005, 36 &amp; Fig. 4). Both Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts have been identified as having copper compositions in an overlapping 4-6% zone. Part-worked or re-worked fragments of Bronze Age gold are sometimes discovered, as single finds or as elements within hoards (e.g. Green 1983; Green &amp; Northover 1996; Gwilt et al 2005; DCMS 2004, 19, Cat. &amp; Fig. 11; DCMS 2007, 22-3, 26, &amp; 39, Cats. &amp; Figs. 5, 7, 17 &amp; 25; British Museum 2008, 22 &amp; 24, 273-5, Cats. &amp; Figs. 27, 33 &amp; 34). Their occurrence as single finds has been increasing in recent years, as better levels of reporting treasure finds have been achieved through the Portable Antiquities Scheme in England and Wales. Therefore, the possibility of this part-worked fragment being a single find of Bronze Age date is also consistent with a wider reported pattern.",,,"ReferencesBritish Museum 2008.

The distance between the inscribed troughs varies slightly, though in the 1.5-3mm range. One end of the strip is slightly wider (c. 16.4mm), with the sides converging slightly towards the opposing end (c. 13.7mm). The strip is folded over along both long side-edges, producing slightly thicker edges (approx. 0.5mm thickness), the folded over widths varying along their respective lengths (c. 0.7-2.8mm and c. 0.7-4.8mm). The narrower end of the strip has a straight and uniform edge, suggesting that the strip was cut with a sharp and straight-edged tool. This may have been a deliberate and simple terminal, or a careful cutting of the strip prior to its burial. The break-edge along the widest end appears is irregular with jagged edges, indicating that it has been broken and that part of the original object is now missing. The fragment has been folded into thirds, probably during or since burial in the ground, the strip now having a roughly Z-shaped profile in side-view. There are frequent small tears where the strip has been partially folded, with one larger tear visible across one face and extending across approximately one-third of the strip&rsquo;s width.Both faces have a yellow-gold patina, but the reverse face, where the folded long edges are visible, appears slightly paler and dulled in appearance. Small quantities of soil are still visible within some of the recesses/creases.Owing to its incompleteness, it is difficult to identify this gold strip to a particular object type with any high degree of certainty. Based on its surviving form and dimensions, it is probable that it once belonged to a broad range of strip or ribbon ornaments of Bronze Age date. Similar strips have been found throughout Britain, including several recent finds from England that have been reported as treasure, with linked Portable Antiquities Scheme records generated (e.g. Bolton 2010; Byard 2018; Downes 2020; Flynn 2020; Gilmore 2016; Needham 2008; Wilkin 2013). In general, these have been loosely dated to the Early or Middle Bronze Ages (ca. 2150-1150 BC) on stylistic and technical grounds. Some of these strips are flat, with parallel linear grooved decoration incised from the front and not showing on the rear surface (e.g. Wilkin 2013). One such example, approximately 8.7cm long and 0.8cm wide, was found from The Hamel, Oxford, associated in a soil context with flint artefacts located near to a Beaker burial containing late Beaker pottery dating to the second half of the Early Bronze Age (ca. 1900-1700 BC) (Palmer 1981, 128-132, Fig. 3.11). The Grosmont sheet strip is both incised and embossed, working from the lower surface to create a true corrugated profile, the rear grooves creating the upper surface ridges. Technologically and stylistically, this may be significant, allying this corrugated strip with either a class of corrugated dagger hilt-bands of Scotland and Ireland or the Embossed gold-working tradition of southern Britain and Ireland. From Scotland and Ireland, corrugated gold hilt bands are a feature of a small number of Early Bronze Age dagger burials, where they serve as pommel mounts (Henshall 1968, 173-195; Needham 2000, 52-54; Becker 2008, 75; Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 905 &amp; 914, Fig. 2; Noble &amp; Brophy 2011, 796-799, Fig. 8a). These may be dated to Period 2 of the Early Bronze Age (ca. 2150-1950 BC) (Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 905 &amp; 914, Fig. 2). Recently, a possible dagger hilt-band has also been recorded as a treasure case (Treasure 2010 T604) from Shrawley, Worcestershire (Bolton 2010; Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 927). This has four embossed ribs, with a surviving length of 2.8cm and a width of 0.95cm. In southern Britain an Embossed gold-working tradition involving the making of armlets, cups and capes was current during later Period 2 and Period 3 of the Early Bronze Age spanning from around 2050-1650 BC (Needham 2000; Needham et al 2006; Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 905 &amp; 914-5, Fig. 2). The corrugated handles of corrugated gold cups (dating from ca. 1850-1650 BC), such as the examples from Ringlemere, Kent, Rillaton, Cornwall and Fritzdorf, Nordrhein-Westfalen (Needham et al 2006) have some similar technical and stylistic features as those witnessed on the Grosmont strip (e.g. corrugated and bordered strips). However, these also differ, by virtue of being made of wider sheet strips, having concave shaped sides rather than straight and slightly tapering sides and showing superior working technique and execution. Nevertheless, their presence and dating provide a plausible wider gold-working context and technological tradition within which this corrugated strip could be located. In combination therefore, both the corrugated hilt bands and the Embossed gold-working tradition provide the most plausible, overlapping cultural, technical and stylistic contexts, spanning between 2150-1650 BC, within which this corrugated gold strip probably sits.&nbsp; Although it is not possible to be certain about the function of this corrugated gold strip from Grosmont community, it closely shares stylistic and technical features with corrugated sheet strips from Askern, Doncaster (Downes, 2020), Chapel and Hill Chorlton, Staffordshire (Gilmore 2016), and Shrawley, Worcestershire (Bolton 2010). These include embossed ridges and grooves, a corrugated profile, folded over margins and similar size ranges. It is possible that they may, in future, be shown to have adorned the hilts or pommels of bronze daggers, as in Scotland and Ireland. However, alternative possible decorative functions may also be revealed in future, when further examples are discovered with more secure contexts and associations.",1,,"ReferencesBecker, K. 2008.

They span the end of the Middle Bronze Age to the Earliest Iron Age (1300-600 BC), but are most common in hoards belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the tenth and ninth centuries BC (Davis 2015, 94). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 &amp; 272; Figs. 32-8 &amp; 40). There are eighteen other known hoards of Ewart Park date (1000-800 BC) from Wales which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the T? Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Llanharan (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge, Penllyn, (all Vale of Glamorgan), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam, Trevethin, (both Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed, Llantilio Crossenny, Llanvihangel Gobion, and Grosmont (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 &amp; 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 &amp; 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 &amp; Fig. 69; Gwilt &amp; Lodwick 2002; 2012; 2016; Gwilt et al 2011; 2012; 2015a; 2015b; 2016a; 2016b; 2018; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85, 108, 121, 141). The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age dating to between 1000 BC and 800 BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 &amp; Fig. 3; Needham et al 1997, 93-8).The lower blade fragment of a spearhead (No. 2 above) is difficult to identify owing to its fragmentary and deformed nature. Although it has been distorted through repeated hammering, the lack of a midrib precludes many recognised types. The observation that this fragment has a bevelled edge also discounts the possibility that this fragment belongs to a spearhead with a Barbed Blade of Group 15 (Davis 2015, 181). It is more likely that this fragment belongs to a spearhead with a Hollow Blade of Davis&rsquo; Group 12 (Davis 2015, 152-162, Nos. 1077-1148, Pls. 98-104) the wide internal hollow aperture providing good evidence to support this assertion. Group 12 spearheads have been found in several hoards spanning the Late Bronze Age, but they largely correlate with the Wilburton and Blackmoor phases of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the late twelfth to late tenth centuries BC (Davis 2015, 162). In Wales, the Guilsfield, Powys, hoard is the only example where Group 12 spearheads are found associated with other artefacts, and this dates to the Blackmoor phase (1020-920 BC) (Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 &amp; 272; Figs. 32-8 &amp; 40). Outside of Wales, Group 12 spearheads are also primarily found in Wilburton and Blackmoor phase hoards from Wilburton, Isleham and Bradley Fen (all Cambridgeshire). Radiocarbon dating has been carried out on two spearheads from the Wilburton and Bradley Fen hoards, providing a date of 1260-940 BC and 1190-930 BC, respectively (Davis 2015, 162). A fragment of a Group 12 spearhead was also found in the Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, hoard which dates to the Ewart Park phase (920-800 BC), and so it is possible that usage of these spearheads might have continued at a low level throughout the latter stages of the Late Bronze Age (Davis 2015, 162). It is also possible that this spearhead fragment represents an old object that continued to circulate as an object, or perhaps as a piece of scrap metal, until the Ewart Park phase. Two of the artefact fragments (Nos. 3 &amp; 4) from within this reported hoard can be identified as tubular spear-ferrules. Based on their different patinated surfaces and the lack of a join between them, the two fragments appear to belong to two separate artefacts, as opposed to deriving from the same object. Ferrules of a long and tubular form have been described as dating to the Wilburton and Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-920), whereas those of a shorter form are more characteristic of the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC) (Burgess et al 1972, 216; Needham 1990, 58). The highly fragmented and distorted nature of the two artefacts means that they lack any further diagnostic features which might allow further identification (Burgess et al 1972, 216), although the evidence for two opposing rivet holes on one (No. 4, above) is a typical feature of ferrules. Spear-ferrules are relatively rare finds from Wales, but they have been found associated within weapon dominated hoards belonging to the Broadward metalworking tradition spanning the Late Bronze Age. As well as the slightly earlier Guilsfield, Powys, which dates to the Blackmoor phase (1020-920 BC), spear ferrules also appear in the Pant-y-Maen, Pembrokeshire weapon hoard, which is dated to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC) and contemporary with the Llanddeusant hoard (Griffiths 1957; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 &amp; 272; Figs. 32-8 &amp; 40; Burgess et al1972, 240).Six of the socketed axes in this reported group (Nos. 5 -10, above) may be identified as South Wales Type socketed axes or Variant forms. The combination of narrow and out-splayed mouths, high placed and ephemeral loops, blocky rectangular or hexagonal form, three ribs descending from the underside of the collars, and evidence for being cast with four-runner technology are all diagnostic elements which, in combination, help to identify this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 &amp; Fig. 1). South Wales Type socketed axes and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g., McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around fifty hoards now contain approaching 250 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Over fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south-western England, southern England, and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 &amp; Fig. 2).The Breiddin Type socketed axe (No. 11, above), with its swollen mouth and ribs descending from a lower horizontal moulding, broadly equates with Southern English Ribbed axes and Type Welby axes in northern Britain (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 221-3; Needham 1990, 32-9). They are uncommon elements of hoards in south-east Wales, although single examples have been found in recently discovered hoards from Cowbridge, Colwinston and Llancarfan (all Vale of Glamorgan) (Gwilt &amp; Lodwick 2002; 2014; Gwilt et al. 2013). They take their name from an example discovered during excavations at The Breiddin hillfort in Powys (Coombs 1990, 133 &amp; 6, Fig. 56). Wood surviving in the socket of this axe was radiocarbon dated, providing a date of 2704+-50bp, calibrating to 908-814 BC at 1 sigma (Musson 1990, 176 &amp; 195, Table 6). Breiddin Type axes are most common in north and east Wales and The Marches (Coombs 1990, 133; Northover unpublished, 253) with examples found within hoards from Plas yn Cefn and Ruabon, Denbighshire, Cherrytree Bank, Powys and Congleton, Cheshire (Davies 1929, 68 &amp; 397; Burgess et al 1972, 236 &amp; 267, Fig. 26; Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust 1977; Savory 1980, 123, Cat. 286 &amp; Fig. 44; Northover unpublished, hoards 41, 48, 55 &amp; 139).One complete socketed axe (No. 12, above) may be identified as of Croxton Type, also known as a particular form of Class B - Southern English ribbed axes (Northover unpublished, 267; Needham 1990, 32-8). The Croxton type, with its diagnostic flaring trumpet mouth, deep collar band and ribs is so named after a defining example found in Cheshire, within a wider frequency observed along the Welsh Marches (Northover unpublished, 267). It is one form within a wider variety of Class B ribbed axes, found in hoards and as single finds across southern Britain. They are almost always found within hoards dating to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800&nbsp;BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Croxton Type socketed axes have been found in increasing numbers of hoards across south-east Wales in recent years, with examples in the Pendoylan, Llantwit Major, Wick Community, Tal-y-garn 1, Colwinston Community, and Llancarfan Community (all Vale of Glamorgan) hoards, as well as an additional example from the St Arvans (Monmouthshire) hoard (Storrie 1887; Fox 1926; GGAT 1977-8; Metcalf &amp; Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, Cats. 280 &amp; 281; 1984, 441b; Northover unpublished, H79 &amp; H124; Gwilt 2004, Appendix 1, Cat. 10; Gwilt &amp; Lodwick 2003; 2005; 2014; Lodwick &amp; Gwilt 2007; Gwilt et al 2013).The slender and faceted bronze socketed axe (No. 13, above) may be identified as of Type Meldreth or Class D faceted axe, which have a variety of sub-types, dependent upon the shape and depth of their collar and mouth shape (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 204-11; Needham 1990, 41-3). The axe from this reported group may be identified as a Variant Aylsham based on the presence of a horizontal moulding at the base of a trumpet-shaped mouth, in place of the collar step of the Type Meldreth itself (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 206-7). Nearly all of the known hoard associations containing Type Meldreth or Class D axes are securely Late Bronze Age in date (1150-800 BC). A few examples have been found in earlier hoards belonging to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age dating to 1150-1000 BC, however most hoard associations may be dated to the succeeding Ewart Park phase dating to 1000-800 BC (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 210-1; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61). This type is generally regarded as a British type, but they do occur in Ireland and France. In Wales, near 40 examples of slender faceted axes of Meldreth or Class D type are now known, mostly from south-east Wales. Examples of these axes have been found in recently reported hoards from Llanfrynach Community (Powys), Grosmont Community (Monmouthshire), Llanharan Community (Rhondda Cynon Taf), and Llanfihangel Cwmdu with Bwlch &amp; Cathedine Community (Powys), all belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2016c; 2018a; 2018b; Knight et al 2018).The complete, small, plain, and waisted socketed axe (No. 14, above) is difficult to identify to a widespread type. The combination of a plain decoration, a simple and flared mouth with a bevelled rim, concave sides, and the positioning of the loop below the rim, are all features consistent with Class 11A axes/Type Portree, Variant Alford axes (Schmidt &amp; Burgess 1981, 188-9, Cats. 1075-93; Eogan 2000, 86-122, Cats. 640-1113C). Whilst the Llanddeusant example does share many of the Class 11A characteristics, it lacks the typical wide and baggy form of these axes. There are however some examples of more slender and waisted Irish axes of this type, and the length and blade width of this example are consistent with the range of dimensions of other Class 11A (Eogan 2000, 87-122, c.f., Nos. 712, 713). All axes of Class 11/Type Portree, Variant Alford can be assigned to the Ewart Park (Dowris) phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). Close parallels for this axe are difficult to find from Wales, but a plain socketed axe of similar form was found within a hoard from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, which is dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Savory 1980, 121, No. 281, Fig. 42). The small, plain, and slender socketed axe with a flared and onset collar (No. 15 above) is also difficult to identify to a widespread type, where the absence of a lower mouth moulding indicates that it is not of Class A &ndash; South-eastern type (e.g., Needham 1990, 28-31). Although it shares some similarities with Class 2A and Type Wallington socketed axes, it lacks the straight collar form of these axes. Close parallels for this axe are difficult to find from Wales, but a plain socketed axe of similar form was found in a hoard from Pendoylan (Vale of Glamorgan) along with one other plain socketed axe and four ribbed socketed axes of South Wales Type (GGAT 1977-8, 31-2; Green 1985, 276-80 Fig. 5 &amp; Pl. 5; Northover unpublished, 209-210, Hoard Cat. H79 &amp; 641). This hoard is dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). Plain slender socketed axes of slightly different forms are now known from numerous Late Bronze Age hoards in Wales, including the Freshwater West (Pembrokeshire), Margam (Neath Port Talbot) and Myddfai (Carmarthenshire) hoards (Briggs &amp; Williams 1995, 46 &amp; Fig 4.1; Northover unpublished H. 38, 76, &amp; 140; Wear unpublished). The socketed axe blade fragment (No. 16, above) belonged to a ribbed socketed axe, however this blade end fragment is not diagnostic to precise type. Various forms of ribbed axes are common components of hoards from south-east Wales and belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). As discussed above, ribbed axes of South Wales Type and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g., McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). In addition, ribbed socketed axes, variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Breiddin Type axes and Llanarth Type axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in several hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales (e.g., Storrie 1887; Metcalf &amp; Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273, 280, 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1.1, 1.3, 1.10; Gwilt &amp; Lodwick 2002; 2004; 2006; Gwilt et al. 2013; Lodwick &amp; Gwilt 2007; Northover unpublished, Hoards 74, 79, 85, 124). Therefore, the presence of this blade-end fragment is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard association from this region.Two of the fragments (Nos. 17 &amp; 18 above) which are enclosed within the socket of a South Wales Type axe are problematic to identify to a known class of finished artefact of Bronze Age date. One of the fragments (No. 17) has a more curvilinear form and a &lsquo;c&rsquo;-shaped section, and so it could possibly have once formed part of the rim of a vessel or perhaps a hollow sectioned bracelet. The second fragment (No. 18) is flatter and has a less pronounced convex exterior, but it could have once belonged to a bronze vessel or belonged to a larger artefact of sheet bronze construction. Ingot, plate and sheet scrap fragments become recognised raw material components of hoards during the Late Bronze Age, particularly in hoards of the Carp&rsquo;s Tongue tradition which often contain an eclectic admixture of decorative pieces, ornamentation, and various pieces of sheet metalworking, and occasionally bronze vessel fragments; this often-fragmented admixture of material is sometimes referred to as bric-a-brac (Burgess 1968, 39). In Britain, the Carp&rsquo;s Tongue complex appears to be an intrusive or specialised metalworking industry which had its centre in northern and western France, appearing alongside the indigenous Ewart Park metalworking tradition (Burgess 1968, 38-9). Although it is impossible to assign the bronze sheet fragments to any known finished object with any degree of certainty, their presence within this hoard is entirely consistent with an Ewart Park date (1000-800 BC).One fragment (No. 19 above) is different from the other enclosed artefacts (Nos. 17 &amp; 18) as it is noticeably thicker, has a c-shaped section, and possesses an everted terminal. It is likely that this fragment was once part of a &lsquo;C&rsquo; sectioned bracelet, and within Davies&rsquo; (2012) reassessment of Late Bronze Age ornaments it can be considered a Type 4E (Outwardly Expanded Solid Terminal with &lsquo;C&rsquo; shaped section). Only a few examples of this type of bracelet exist from Britain, with bronze examples found in Carp&rsquo;s Tongue hoards from Petters Sports Field, Surrey (Needham 1990, 62), Leigh II, Kent (Turner 1998, vol II, 137, fig. 55), Minnis Bay, Kent (Turner 1998, vol III, 105, fig. 49, no. 19/52), and a gold example from Bexley, Kent (Hook &amp; Needham 1989, 16, No. 5). Although they possess similar morphological traits, the four bronze bracelets are quite varied in terms of the presence of decoration, type of decoration, the thickness of the bar, and the degree to which the edges enclose the internal gap. The bracelet fragment from the Leigh II (Kent) hoard is the closest in form to the example from this reported group, but it is decorated with lateral ribs around the surviving terminal (Turner 1998, vol II, 137, fig. 56). Although the Llanddeusant fragment is plain, the majority of it is hidden within the socket of the axe and so there is the possibility that decorative elements might be found on those sections of the object which are obscured within the socket of the axe. In terms of overall style, the undecorated Llanddeusant bracelet is closer paralleled with the C-sectioned bracelets found in Carp&rsquo;s Tongue hoards from western France (Coffyn, Gomez and Mohen 1981, 134-9, Pl. 30-32), suggesting that the object was made in France and evidence for inter-regional exchange between west Wales and western France. C-sectioned bronze bracelets are not considered a diagnostic element of the Carp&rsquo;s Tongue complex (Burgess 1968, 38-9; Matthews 2013, 57-9; Brandherm &amp; Moskal-del-Hoyo 2014, footnote 60), but their presence and association as components within these hoards suggests a date within the ninth century BC and contemporary with the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC).The jet of one-runner form (No. 20, above) is the excess reservoir of metal at the top of a mould and a bi-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. There are numerous Ewart Park hoards from south and west Wales which have jets as components within them, where examples with between one and four runners are known (e.g., Storrie 1887; Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 274, 281 &amp; 284, Figs. 31, 42 &amp; 43; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 &amp; 4; Gwilt &amp; Lodwick 2018; Northover unpublished, H 23, 74, 78, 125).In combination, all of the artefacts included in this hoard can be confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC) (Needham 1996, Needham et al 1997). The majority of the artefacts retain chronologically diagnostic features, and the overall composition and character of the hoard indicates that it was deposited during the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC). The Group 12 spearhead is slightly earlier in manufacture and largely belongs to the Wilburton and Blackmoor phases of the Late Bronze Age (1150-920 BC), but later examples have been found in hoards of Ewart Park date and so its presence does not present a dating problem.",1,,"PLEASE NOTE: This hoard is the topic of an ongoing piece of active research towards wider publications.

Single, stray finds of coins are not counted as treasure, whereas any ornament of precious metal at least 300 years old is eligible under the Treasure Act 1996.As explained in Gillian Varndell&rsquo;s paper &lsquo;Ringing the changes: when terminology matters&rsquo; in Antiquity 75 (2001: 515-16) the term &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; or &lsquo;tress-ring&rsquo; has often been applied to these objects by archaeologists. Others have used the terms literally, believing these objects to be either an early form of currency or hair ornaments, though there is evidence for neither. The Code of Practice of the 1996 Treasure Act is quite clear on the definition of &#39;coin&#39;. This includes &#39;any metal token that was, or can reasonably be assumed to have been, used or intended for use as or instead of money&#39;. However, this only includes coins and tokens &#39;made after the introduction of the first coinage into this country during the lron Age period and excludes objects made earlier such as iron currency bars&#39; (Section 3 [2] of the Act and p.4 of the Code of Practice). Bronze Age gold penannular rings should therefore be regarded as an ornament and several subsequent examples have been treated as such see: 2023 T312 (YORYM-2A8B0B), 2023 T1080 (WMID-A28DF7), 2023 T783 (SUR-8A035F), 2023 T177 (CAM-23BCAB), 2011 T499 (LANCUM-80A136), and 2005 T201 (IOW-240A63).",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2000-07-30T00:00:00Z,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","North Yorkshire",Harrogate,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder after being declared not Treasure",,1287224,images/bmorris/,YORYM-A02CFB_66aa05e704252.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,YORYM,2024-07-31T10:24:31Z,2024-08-08T14:12:18Z

There is also a small flake of gold plating missing from the external surface of the ring, exposing a green copper-alloy core. There is a small circumferential crack on one side of the ring and a transverse crack on the outer surface, located opposite the gap between the terminals. The gap is approximately 1.95 mm. There is no sign of banding in differential shades of gold, this being a common form of decoration on similar rings.Dimensions: diameter 16.37 mm, width 4.81 mm, thickness 4.31 mm.&nbsp;Weight: 4.41 g.Discussion: These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800&nbsp;BC). They have been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008), but their function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating. However, burials in Belgium, north-east France, and The Netherlands, in addition to Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 BC (Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, evidence for earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, this penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC). Similar undecorated penannular rings on the PAS database include SUR-C145ED, BM-275770, HAMP-2419C2 and LANCUM-C2543F.Scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008).

It consists of five distinct components: two decorated terminals affixed at either end of three spiral-twisted bars (47cm in length, excluding the terminals) with a regular cruciform (i.e. &lsquo;+&rsquo; shaped) cross section. The torc from Leicestershire has such deep flanges that they are almost cut away from the central cruciform. Taylor (1980, 61-2) discusses the advantages of casting an elaborate torc in multiple pieces. The terminals are unique in appearance, with few comparable examples. While such torcs typically feature &lsquo;trumpet&rsquo;-shaped terminals, this example instead has sheet gold ferrules adorned with three decorative bands. These bands, incised with lines to give the impression of twisting, are evenly spaced and soldered onto the torc afterward. Additionally, strand 1 is broken, with the damaged ends appearing crushed.The construction of this torc is unusual in comparison with other contemporary examples, with the closest parallel being the Moulsford torc from Berkshire (Hawkes, 1961). Typically, torcs from this period feature a single flange-twisted bar with &lsquo;trumpet&rsquo;-shaped terminals and range in length from 40cm to 126cm. Examples of multi-stranded flange-twisted torcs are rare and include the torc from the Towednack Hoard, Cornwall (Eogan, 1967), the Monkton Deverill torc, Wiltshire (unpublished, Salisbury Museum collection), and the Moulsford torc (Hawkes, 1961). However, of these, the Moulsford torc is the only example that incorporates multiple strands set into sheet gold ferrules, making it similar to the torc under discussion.One of the strands is broken, and its ends appear to have been deliberately hammered to compress the flanges. This is reminiscent of the torc fragments discovered at Woodham Walter, Essex (Meeks and Varndell, 1994). However, while the Woodham Walter fragments were significantly flattened, the example under discussion seems to have been crushed specifically to remove the flange twisting.The torc measures approximately 47cm in length and weights 243g, making it relatively light compared to other examples, such as the Ely torc, which weights 732g. There is an approximate gap of c. 4 mm between the flanges and the flanges themselves have a length of c. 3mm. The spiral of the bar has been created by twisting it in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions: two strands are twisted clockwise, while one is twisted anti-clockwise. However, it is possible that the torc was originally made by twisting a single long bar in a clockwise direction (approximately 141cm in length), which was later cut into three segments. One segment may have then been reorientated to create the appearance of anti-clockwise twisting. The segments were then capped at the ends, forming a smaller torc. The edges of the flanges are blunt, with no lipping or burring present.&nbsp; Further research is needed to fully understand the precise construction details of this torc and to gain broader insights into flange-twisted gold torcs in general. The terminals of the torc are gold sheet ferrules, stylistically similar to those of the Moulsford torc but assembled in a different manner. This example features three gold wire ornaments encircling each ferrule at evenly spaced intervals. The gold wire is incised to mimic twisted appearance, while the end of the ferrule bears a rough incised cross which has been &lsquo;filled in&rsquo;. The decoration on the terminals shows greater similarity to torc examples found in France and one example in Ireland than those found in England. For instance, the incised terminals resemble the Torque de Saint-Jean-Trolimon, a torc fragment found in the Seine and also a torc from Co.Mayo (Armbruster, 2021; 153). However, while the end of the ferrule is stylistically similar to that of the Moulsford torc, the Moulsford example is executed with greater finesse and assembled in a different way. The ferrule is constructed in multiple stages, incorporating the cuff, cap, and three pieces of wire, all soldered together. This torc has been coiled around once to form a compact bundle. The method of coiling is consistent with examples such as the torcs from Grunty Fen, Cambridgeshire; the Ropley torc in Hampshire; and the Yeovil torc (Taylor, 1980).Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis was undertaken on the torc by the Science department of the British Museum. It indicated a surface composition of approximately 85-87% gold and 10-12% silver, the rest being copper. This composition is consistent along the length of the bar but varies slightly at the terminals with a surface composition of 83-85% gold and 12-14% silver. Unassociated findsIn addition to the torc, two pieces of undiagnostic copper alloy were discovered. The pieces are complete and intact suggesting that they represent casting waste. While it is possible that they are Bronze Age, they were not found at the same location as the torc, they were recovered from within the same field, based on the coordinates provided by the finder. They therefore do not form part of this Treasure case but have been included in this report for the sake of completeness.

However, no Middle Bronze Age torcs are known from Leicestershire itself. The closest example of a multi-stranded torc is the Moulsford torc from Berkshire, however Moulsford was bar-twisted rather than flange-twisted and includes four rather than three strands. Other multi-strand torcs, such as the Towednack torc and the Monkton Deverill torc, terminate in trumpet-shaped terminals rather than the ferrule-like terminals seen on this example. This raises questions about the construction of this torc and similar examples. Why does this example shows three strands (and similarly the Moulsford torc with four)? Were the strands fashioned from a single long flanged bar that was cut into segments, or were they made separated and then combined? These considerations open further avenues for discussion and research into the manufacturing techniques of multi-strand torcs. Taylor discusses the advantages of torcs with separately formed terminals, although this was with a focus on trumpet-shaped terminals. While ferrule terminals, like those present on this torc, are less common, they provide similar benefits. Specifically, they contribute to the overall neat appearance through having uniform twists that extend the whole length of the torc before being capped. An interesting aspect of the Leicestershire torc is the break in one of the strands. If the torc had been broken and discarded, it would typically be assumed that the break would have been left as is. However, the broken ends were re-worked to flatten the flanges, suggesting an attempt to repair the break- or at least to prepare for repair without completing it. This is reminiscent of a spiral-twisted torc found in the Wylie hoard in Wiltshire (Treasure case 2012 T786), which features a section that is globular in form, untwisted, and undecorated, possibly indicating a repair.The functionality of coiled torcs has been debated, with suggestions that they were too narrow to be worn on the arm or leg. It has been proposed that the coiling instead served as a means of decommissioning the torcs prior to deposition (Ramsey 2012). However, the coiling effect of the multi-stranded torc enhances the impression that it may have been reworked from an earlier object. ConclusionThe torc is made of more than 10% precious metal (in this case gold) and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996). The two pieces of copper alloy (possibly casting waste) are not diagnostic and therefore do not qualify as Treasure under the Act (1996) or Designation Order (2002).

There is a collar formed under the terminals and a line cut into them giving the appearance of a mouth, although this is probably coincidental.

Similar examples were also found in the Priddy hoard (2005T523, SOM-1C2C53). The British Museum also holds several similar examples (Accession numbers 1873,0602.1, 1838,0718.1 and 1857,0729.1).&nbsp; Taylor (1980, Plate 42, 64) notes that these torcs are of &#39;Welsh type&#39;, although related to one found in Swineford, Co. Mayo,&nbsp;and seem to originate as a local development in the&nbsp;mid Bronze Age, remaining in vogue until the late part of the period. The British Museum entry for 1873,0601.1 states &#39;There is a considerable debate regarding the dating of Ribbon Torcs either to the Middle Bronze Age or Iron Age on the basis of compositional analyses, terminal forms and limited contextual evidence as from Somerset, Co. Galway and Dooyork, Co Mayo, Ireland and the Blair Drummond hoard, Stirling, Scotland. The emerging typological consensus places loosely coiled&nbsp;torcs with simple hook terminals from Ireland in the Middle Bronze Age whilst tightly coiled torcs with knobbed terminals in Britain and Ireland are placed in the Iron Age (Fraser Hunter, Mary Cahill, Jody Joy and Trevor Cowie pers. comm. 9/12/11)&#39;.

It consists of&nbsp;a rectangular gold plate with expanded terminals, which would have been bent into a circular form to wrap around a wrist but is now distorted into an irregular wavy form.The plate is widest at its midpoint where it is c.10.5mm wide and 1.1mm thick. It is mostly straight-sided for its middle third&nbsp;but&nbsp;narrows along&nbsp;its remaining length,&nbsp;becoming as narrow as 4.2mm just before its&nbsp;terminals. Here it begins to expand in width and thickness, becoming oval in cross-section, to form two flared flat-ended terminals. One is 9.5mm long and 8.5mm wide; the other is more circular, being 9.0mm long and 8.7mm wide. The bracelet&#39;s long edges are slightly expanded, giving each the feel of a subtle lip or flange&nbsp;running along their length. It is otherwise undecorated.The bracelet retains its gold lustre, but has several scratches across its surfaces and occasional soil concreted to its surface.Dimensions: Using a string,&nbsp;it is possible to estimate the unbent length of the bracelet as c. 155mm. In its current state however it is 78.5mm long, and weighs 25.37g.Discussion: The bracelet has several parallels on the database. For example there are a number of fragments which contain a rectangular body which narrows and then expands to a flared terminal such as NMGW-E48854, DOR-86B8B9 (2020T480) and CORN-705C14 (2020T222) the latter being found in a hoard of goldwork.Further similar examples are also illustrated by Eogan (1994) from Caister on Sea Norfolk (Eogan 1994: pl 13, no. 1) and Berwickshire (Eogan 1994: pl 15, no. 6) while another is held by the British Museum (Accession number: WG.7 ) all of which are also suggested to date to the Late Bronze Age. This is supported by a bracelet with an expanded terminal being found with a Late Bronze Age socketed axehead at Llanarmon-yn-I&acirc;l in Denbighshire (Green 1983). These are sometimes termed Potterne type bracelets following the publication of a similar bracelet from this site (Taylor 1984).The form also corresponds to Hook and Needham&#39;s (1989) Class B1 bracelet (which may or may not have the flanges). Hook and Needham list 21 examples of Class B1 and related bracelets from Britain and Europe, with a clear concentration of the type in southern England and with a band stretching across north Wales and Cheshire.Conclusion: The bracelet appears to consist of more than 10% precious metal and at the time of finding was more than 300 years old, it thus qualifies as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.Authors: Dr Edward Caswell, Finds Liaison Officer, OxfordshireReferencesEogan, G.

One terminal has a slightly rounded end while the other has a slightly&nbsp;diagonal not quite ragged break.The outer surface of the sheet has incised decoration consisting of 13 parallel lines that run the length of the object taking up its entire width. This creates a ridged design.

Further multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) while an in-context example has been found&nbsp;from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium&nbsp;BC.As such there are a number of parallels spread from across the country that would support this is Bronze age in date, these tend to be suggested to be Early Bronze Age but the Penard dated hoard cited above suggests they may also date later into the Bronze Age.Conclusion:&nbsp;&nbsp;The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

In one obvious place the gold has come away, possibly due to copper alloy corrosion from the core beneath. One terminal has retained its gold plating, while the other has lost it leaving a jagged terminal. Dimensions: Thickness: 5.4 mm; Weight: 2.15 g; Diameter: 13.2 mm.Discussion: Penannular rings are well-attested Bronze Age finds with many comparable examples recorded through the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. See for example, 2023 T312 (YORYM-2A8B0B), 2019 T1247 (DUR-B76D9B) and 2019 T1012 (DUR-1B2FA1). The record for the latter two examples notes that There is no clear consensus in terms of how these penannular rings may have been used in the past. Although latterly often described as &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; (implying they were decorative elements worn in the hair) and as &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; to be used as a proto-monetary exchange object and used in trade, there is no evidence for either of these uses. Although it is unlikely they were worn in the hair, the possibility remains that they were worn on the body and used as personal adornment (e.g. as earrings or nose-rings).Eogan&rsquo;s (2004) distribution shows that Bronze Age penannular rings are found in both Britain and Ireland and a small number have been found in northwest continental Europe. Finds recorded on the PAS database for England and Wales reflect a general bias towards southern Britain, with very few recorded in Wales and northern England. This particular penannular ring (2024 T347 / DUR-2FFBF0) fits generally with this distribution pattern.A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). As such 2019-T1012 (DUR-1B2FA1) as Type 3d: &lsquo;gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo;. Analysis of a similar example in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex. Penannular rings of this form, particularly gold sheet examples with stripes, are generally considered to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;800BC; Needham 2007, 33).Conclusion: The age and precious metal content of this object meets the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.

It is not quite circular, being slightly longer in width (when held with terminals upwards or downwards) and slightly shorter in length (from terminals to the opposite side&nbsp;of the ring, which might be thought of as the centre of the object). The circular cross-section flares very slightly from a minimum of 3.5mm diameter at the centre&nbsp;to 3.8mm at the terminals; the terminals&nbsp;are flat-ended, at a slight angle to each other&nbsp;and c. 2mm apart. From the tiny cracks and seams in the gold at the terminals, it appears that a piece of sheet gold projected from the outside of either end and was then bent in to cover the flat end of the terminal, suggesting that the ring may have been made from a core wrapped in sheet gold. The ring is in good condition, however, and there is no other visible evidence that it is not solid gold. The surface has lots of tiny pits and scratches, but there is no hint of decoration.Dimensions: Length from gap in ring to centre of object, 12.8mm. Width 14.1mm, maximum thickness 3.8mm, internal width 7.2mm. Weight 2.46g.Discussion: There are over a hundred of these rings recorded on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database, with a distribution focused on central southern England, but this is a relatively small and slim example of the type; only a few weigh less than 3g. Good parallels include&nbsp;WILT-299199,&nbsp;ESS-046731 and&nbsp;SUR-491236.Although they have in the past been called &#39;hair-rings&#39; or&nbsp;&#39;ring-money&#39;, their function remains uncertain (see for example discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196). They have until recently been given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal&nbsp;BC, based firstly on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly on&nbsp;Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997).

Both sides are undecorated.Dimensions: Diameter 20.1mm; width 6.4mm; thickness 1.3mm; approximate straight length 95mm; weight 10.51g.Discussion: The object has few diagnostic features being made of a thin strip of gold. Gold bands are relatively undiagnostic component of (perhaps especially Middle and Later) Bronze Age goldwork in Southern England (c.1500-800 BC) (see Murgia et al. 2014a; Murgia et al. 2014b). A Bronze Age date is supported by those gold ribbons with more diagnostic features including SOM-A4086 (2018T164) and DOR-86B8B9 (2020T480) identified as bracelets, OXON-A33005 (2022T736) recorded as a ribbon, YORYM-B1A82B (2021T608) recorded as a mount, and BERK-73615E (2020T803), an unidentified object, as well as two objects identified as bracelets which made up part of a hoard from Wiltshire (WILT-DE7029; 2022T800). All have been folded, suggesting that the folding of such objects prior to deposition is a phenomenon mostly occurring in the Bronze Age. SUR-4956AF (2017T922) and HAMP-EA6ECD (2017T1156) are both undecorated examples dated to the Bronze Age, the latter partly due to it being folded.However, there are also examples which are suggested to come from the Roman to Early Medieval period (NLM-E8C60D, SWYOR-089827 and IOW-36803C). In the British Museum&#39;s collections, 2010,8032.9 is an undecorated folded gold strip dated 1300BC-750BC, whilst folded gold strips not dating to the Bronze Age include 1996,0701.2 dated 50 BC - AD 50 and 1986,0401.350.d from the Snettisham hoard dated to the Roman period, both in the British Museum&#39;s collections.This piece of gold is undecorated, slightly thicker than most recorded examples, and less tightly folded, making it difficult to date with any certainty. Perhaps the closest in thickenss is from the Llanarmon-yn-I&acirc;l Hoard (Green 1983) which would support a Bronze Age date. Similarly, the site is near to the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age hillfort, Liddington Camp and other Bronze Age activity in the area includes WILT-BD61FB (2022 T471) a Late Bronze Age hoard of three socketed axeheads, SUR-B10DA4 (2024T323) a Bronze Age gold bracelet, and WILT-F6A02E, a Bronze Age scraper. Approximately 10 Roman coins, as well as one or two medieval and post medieval coins, have also been found nearby, but on the balance of probabilities this band can also be assigned to the Bronze Age, although a more precise date within the period is difficult to ascertain.Conclusion: The object is over 300 years old and comprises over 10% precious metal.

The outside is neatly made and well polished, including the bevelled short edges. The inside, however, is not nearly so neat; the surfaces are rough and the edges of each element&nbsp;are crumpled where they have been&nbsp;joined together. The longitudinal seams are&nbsp;slightly overlapping, so that the total width (or depth) of the ring at 8.3mm is less than the sum of&nbsp;the width of each individual element. Traces of surplus gold can be seen in places within the seams on the outside, suggesting that gold solder used to join the three elements. The absence of this on top or bottom edges&nbsp;suggests&nbsp;that the ring has always only consisted of these three elements.&nbsp;The second, single-element ring is of similar proportions to the individual&nbsp;elements of the tripartite ring, being made up of a strip 3.2mm wide with convex polished exterior face and hollow inner. The hollow&nbsp;inside&nbsp;has the same rough&nbsp;appearance as the elements of the tripartite ring, but the long edges are a little different. Both are&nbsp;flatter, and one has a slight longitudinal groove added on the exterior close to the edge.&nbsp;The single ring is now bent so that the loop is smaller and sub-square, and the open ends&nbsp;are now side by side. One end&nbsp;has a clear short groove across close to the end, wider and neater than the longitudinal groove, and both ends have bevelled ends which look as if they have been made using similar grooves.The rings have been cleaned by the finder and can now be separated, but a photograph of it at the time of finding shows them linked together, and so that is likely to be the way in which they were deposited.Dimensions:&nbsp; Diameter of tripartite ring, c. 15mm; total width (or depth) of all three elements together, 8.3mm; total thickness, c. 2mm; weight 4.30g.&nbsp;Diameter of single ring, c. 11-13mm; width of its single element&nbsp;3.2mm; thickness 1.2mm; weight 1.42g.The thickness of both rings is hard to measure, but the quoted thickness is in total, across the curve of each element. Total weight of both elements, 5.72g.Discussion: There are several other tripartite penannular gold rings recorded on the PAS database, but they tend to have elements with solid cross-sections. Similar C-shaped cross-sections are found on a few, including&nbsp;IOW-0EAD26,&nbsp;ESS-CB3683 and apparently&nbsp;BUC-9754C7, although the photograph of this last example appears to contradict the description by showing&nbsp;flat inner surfaces. It has been suggested that&nbsp;YORYM-06C5C1, with a very deeply hollowed interior, might have been a sheet cover for a base-metal core, but this is perhaps less likely for 2024T411, as any core would have been clearly visible.&nbsp;The linking&nbsp;of a tripartite ring to another object is also well paralleled. A good parallel on the PAS database is&nbsp;ESS-F1E21D (2023T194, from Beaumont-cum-Moze), where two tripartite rings with solid cross-sections are linked together. These small rings are often found threaded onto larger objects,&nbsp;for example in the Stretham (Cambs) hoard, discovered in 1850 and now in the British Museum (1884,0520.3). Here two&nbsp;three-strand rings are interlinked, and one&nbsp;in turn strung on a larger penannular bracelet (Eogan 1967, 141-143, fig 3.2;&nbsp;Eogan 1994, p. 56, fig. 22.4).Cowie et al (2011, 22) comment that &quot;the presence of diminutive rings threaded on to the hoops of some torcs and bracelets suggests that the smaller rings may have served as dangles on larger ornaments&quot; and further examples can be seen at&nbsp;BM-261FA2 (2004T81, from north-east Norfolk),&nbsp;LANCUM-D7E08D (2023T1094, from near Barnoldswick, Lancashire)&nbsp;and&nbsp;BERK-A5FFE5 (2009T755, from the Windsor area).Date: Middle Bronze Age,&nbsp;c.1300-1150&nbsp;BC.",,,"As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-03-02T00:00:00Z,2024-03-02T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,Breckland,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1291280,images/hgeake2/,NMS-020297_66d0ab0b0b8d3.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2024-03-12T09:28:09Z,2025-07-04T09:20:18Z

This was likely achieved by cutting and hammering. The tapered end has been cut, indicated by a bright rugged cut. The terminal also appears to have been cut from a larger object and then hammered smooth.&nbsp;The gold has&nbsp;a rich, bright yellow colour.&nbsp;Measurements:&nbsp;Length: 14.77 mm; Width: 7.03 mm; Thickness: 6.43 - 2.37 mm and Weight: 6.5 g.Discussion:&nbsp;Gold ingots generally fall into three main date ranges: Bronze Age, Early Medieval and Modern. While gold ingots are often dated to the Early Medieval period, in association with the Viking bullion economy, this piece is not diagnostic of the other examples on this database (see BERK-842965, HAMP-3C8EAE&nbsp;and GLO-64767B). This example also weighs 6.5 g which does not conform to the Anglo-Scandinavian &ouml;rtugar - mark weight system (as outlined in Kruse, 1988 and in Haldeny &amp; Kershaw, 2014). Additionally, the ingot does not appear to be Modern, due to the high purity of the gold content. Thus, it suggests that this could be Bronze Age, as will be discussed below. The surrounding area has mainly produced Post-Medieval finds, with no Bronze Age or Early Medieval activity recorded on the PAS or the Kent Historic Environment Record. However, 3 km from the ingot findspot was KENT-8C3793, a gold torc fragment dating to the Iron Age which may suggest more local prehistoric activity that previously thought.The shape of the ingot is strikingly similar to a number of Bronze Age dated examples. Most notably is the hack gold present in the Middle Bronze Age Fittleworth Hoard, dated from 1400-1100 BC, currently in the collection of the&nbsp;British Museum. The record IOW-9F0C84&nbsp;(and the addenda IOW-21EDC1) shows Late Bronze Age (c.1150-800 BC) hack gold in association with penannular rings that display the characteristic oblique &lsquo;V&rsquo; shape seen&nbsp;on this example. These examples suggest that the hack gold is a fragment of a penannular bracelet; other database examples of a similar form are also identified as bracelet fragments as are the objects alongside the hack gold in the Fittleworth Hoard. IOW-50D55F is a Late Bronze Age penannular bracelet that has been &lsquo;snipped&rsquo; and modified to become hack gold. CORN-705C14, SWYOR-DDC942, Green (1983) and Eogan (1994) also discuss bracelet fragments that are reminiscent of hack gold.Other isolated fragments posited as Bronze Age, such as&nbsp;BH-E08E66,&nbsp;SOM-E5EF83&nbsp;and&nbsp;NMS-E6AF84, have been deemed Not Treasure on the balance of probability due to the lack of diagnostic indicators. However, it is argued above that this object is diagnostic enough to be considered Bronze Age and, as such, Treasure.Treasure Conclusion:&nbsp;It is therefore clear that this object dates to before 1724 and as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South East",Kent,Sevenoaks,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1265640,images/isabelledigglekent/,KENT-731554_65e09a781d2d2.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,KENT,2024-02-22T11:34:45Z,2024-03-28T13:25:17Z

The corrosion likely indicates that it was made by covering a circular copper-alloy bar with gold sheet and hammering it flat, giving it the appearance of being made from solid gold. The ring was decorated with silver or silver rich gold wire, which covers the ring in a continuous spiral that provides a striped effect. Overall, it is in fairly good condition, but there are a couple of scratches, nicks and dents in the surface, as well as some damage around the terminals.&nbsp;Penannular gold rings are often inlaid with bands of paler gold, also known as electrum (a naturally occurring silvery gold). This creates&nbsp;a striped effect with each gold or electrum stripe being around a millimetre or less in width.Date: c.1600-800 BCDimensions: Outer width, 15.3mm. Length of space between terminals, 4mm (average). Diameter of internal perforation, 6mm.

Six Bronze Age gold penannular rings were illustrated in the Treasure Annual Report 2003 (p. 196-197). While this is the first gold Bronze Age penannular ring to be recorded for Cornwall, this type of find is not unusual for the South West, with 5 being recorded from Dorset, 4 from Somerset, and 1 from Devon. However, it is noted that this example is very highly decorated, especially when considered in comparative terms to other examples from the South West. However, there are closely comparable objects of this type and age on the database, including three from the above mentioned sub-set, all from Dorset: 2015T809 (DOR-0A6139), 2013T383 (DOR-18E227),&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2011T229 (DOR-D914C7).It is not clear how these rings were used. In the past they were called &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; because they were thought to have been worn in the hair and they have been called &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; as they were thought to have been used as a proto-monetary exchange object and used in trade (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although use as hair decoration has been ruled out. However, the possibility remains that they were worn on the body and used as personal adornment (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196).Eogan&rsquo;s (2004) distribution shows that Bronze Age penannular rings are found in both Britain and Ireland and a small number have been found in northwest continental Europe.&nbsp;Finds recorded on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database for England and Wales reflect a general bias towards southern Britain, with fewer recorded in Wales and northern England.A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3d gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.These penannular rings, especially the gold sheet examples with stripes, are generally considered to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;800BC; Needham 2007, 33).There is a suspected Bronze Age Barrow site nearby, which this find may be associated with:&nbsp;Heritage Gateway - Results.Conclusion:This object contains more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

The object is made of a single rectangular sheet of gold that has been folded in a spiral over 540 degrees and then squashed almost flat.&nbsp; It is decorated by a series of c.22 nearly parallel incised lines running across its length creating a decorative ridged design. Each line is placed circa 0.5mm apart. As its visible edges appear to be cut, rather than broken, it is likely that this object is complete.Dimensions: Length (remaining), 13mm. Width (average; not diameter as it is now flattened), 7.5mm. Average thickness of the gold sheet, 0.23mm.Weight: 0.68g.Discussion: The linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and &#39;ribbons&#39; of known and very probable Bronze Age date, including finds from Wiltshire, Shropshire, Nottinghamshire, Gloucestershire, and Suffolk (LVPL-954858, LVPL-25FCB6, LVPL-34D297, GLO-F8F3B7, and SF-D30D10). Similar narrow embossed strips are also illustrated by Taylor (1980, fig 28a-f) which are suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age. Multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) while an in-context example has been found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980), in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd-early 2nd millennium BC.As such there are a number of parallels spread from across the country that would support that this object is Bronze Age in date. Objects of this kind tend to be suggested to be Early Bronze Age, but the Penard dated hoard cited above suggests they may also date later into the Bronze Age.Conclusion: This object contains more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

The fragment possibly formed part of a bracelet or pendant, or another form of jewellery, such as an ear ornament. The ribbon is made from a buttery-yellow sheet gold. In plan, the remaining fragment is sub-triangular, or tongue-shaped. There is a narrow terminal, with a slightly convex edge. There is a circular perforation near the edge of the terminal. The perforation has been pierced from one side, leaving a slight lip around the hole on the opposing side. From the terminal, the ribbon tapers outward, ending in a worn transverse break. The ribbon is flat and undecorated, but slight undulations are visible, probably from when it was hammered. The longitudinal edges of the ribbon are flat.Dimensions: The extant ribbon is 26.29 mm in length, the strip is 5.58 mm in width at the terminal and 11.95 mm in width at the break, and 0.63 mm thick.

This is a complete and very small penannular ring of gold with incised linear decoration around its sides and external diameter surface. Judging from surface dents and a localised small tear near one terminal on the external surface and sides, and the light weight of the ring, a sheet construction with hollow or non-metal core may be suggested. The ring is near circular, though slightly wider from side-to-side than from front-to-back, with near touching terminals. The terminals have slightly convex or domed gold end-faces. The body is oval-sectioned, widest between upper and lower surfaces relative to internal and external surfaces. There are no visible seams running along any of the surfaces of the ring.The decoration comprises three parallel zones made up of repeating short, incised line decoration running completely around the sides and external surfaces of the ring body. Each zone of lines is angled on a diagonal to create a double chevron or herringbone pattern. Seen from one face, the V direction of the chevron goes in one direction, while that on the opposing face goes in the opposite direction. The interior surface of the ring is plain. The slight damage and denting to one terminal end of the ring may have happened in antiquity, since soil survives adhering to the dented surfaces and there is no evidence of newly exposed break edge surfaces.

Each &lsquo;tooth&rsquo; strand is approximately 2mm wide and approximately 4mm deep and separated by soil-filled gaps, each 1mm wide. The maximum surviving length of one of the teeth is approximately 38mm long. Any evidence of any possible handle component, into which the teeth may once have combined and belonged, has not survived, leaving just the partial burnt &lsquo;teeth&rsquo; component of a possible larger original. The wooden artefact has been completely burnt black and carbonised within a reducing environment, resulting in its long-term preservation in the ground.",1,,"4.0 Recommendation (AG)It is my opinion that the penannular ring is a prehistoric gold artefact whose composition has been tested and found to be well over 10% precious metal, therefore does constitute treasure. The burnt wooden &lsquo;toothed&rsquo; artefact fragment was found in direct association with the ring, therefore as an associated artefact, is also recommended as treasure (see Section CI, paragraphs 6 &amp; 8 and Section CII, paragraph 14 of the Treasure Act 1996; Code of Practice (2nd Revision) (DCMS 2008,10-12). The associated human cremation, as a non-artefact deposit, is deemed an unworked natural object and is recommended as not qualifying as treasure (see Section CII, paragraph 13 of the Treasure Act 1996; Code of Practice (2nd Revision) (DCMS 2008, 11).Essential References DCMS, 2008.

The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved.

Casting &#39;flaws&#39; or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina.

The cross-section tapers very slightly towards the terminals, which are flat and set at right angles. The surface is smoothly polished.The narrow gap between the two flat terminals is blocked by corrosion which includes some green copper compounds, suggesting that there is an inner core of copper alloy, although there are no cracks in the gold visible underneath&nbsp;the corrosion.Dimensions: The gap in the ring measures c. 2.5mm wide.

The terminals are cleanly cut and form a narrow gap measuring 1.8 mm. The ring is a bright gold in colour and is even across the surface and ends. There is no suggestion of differential gold or silver banding, as can be seen on&nbsp;examples such as&nbsp;KENT-D6DB1B.Measurements: Length: 13.14 mm; Internal Width: 7.3 mm;&nbsp;External Width: 14.22 mm; Gap Width: 2.39 mm&nbsp;Thickness: 3.63 mm and Weight: 4.6&nbsp;g.Discussion: These class of objects are a well-known Bronze Age type with a concentrated distribution in central southern England. Initially, these were dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1000 - 800 cal BC, due to northern European burial and hoarding evidence. However, further excavated examples have pushed for an earlier date, such as an association with twisted torc and bracelet fragments from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Needham 2007).Thus, these objects are situated within a wider date range, encompassing the Middle and Late Bronze Age, c. 1300 - 800 BC.The function of penannular rings remains uncertain. Previously, they have been well recorded as &#39;hair-rings&#39; or &#39;ring-money&#39; (see Taylor 1981; Eogan 1994; Eogan 1997; Varndell 2001; Meeks et al 2008). However, rather than being hair ornaments or objects of exchange, it is posited that these were personal adornments worn on the ears or nose (Armbruster 2021: 191-196).Some examples are solid gold whilst others are a copper alloy core wrapped in gold sheet. The even gold colouring on this example and the lack of copper alloy corrosion suggests this is comprised of solid gold. However, the ring is noticeably lighter in weight than many solid gold examples on the database. A British Museum study has&nbsp;suggested the rings were created using strips of silvery gold inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil.&nbsp;Thus, the object&#39;s composition is difficult to determine.Further discussions of these objects can be seen at&nbsp;ESS-EDCA69&nbsp;and&nbsp;NMS-775561.Treasure Conclusion: It is therefore clear that this object likely dates to before 1723 and as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of the The Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-09-16T00:00:00Z,,"South East","West Sussex",Chichester,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Declared Treasure but returned to Finder as Museum unable to acquire",,1261254,images/isabelledigglekent/,KENT-6B8C19_65bd0128db35e.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,KENT,2023-10-11T16:01:21Z,2024-05-24T10:22:57Z

The ring is circular in cross section. It has been made from a solid gold round sectioned, straight bar which has had a silvery strip inlaid in a continuous spiral to provide a striped colour effect. The bar has then been bent round into a penannular shape with flat faced terminals with a narrow space between them. The faces show evidence of the construction technique. The surface is otherwise undecorated. The outer surface of the ring is worn while there is little evidence of wear on the inner surface of the centre of the penannular ring.Dimensions: 17.6mm outer diameter; 5.43mm inner diameter; 6.7mm thickness; 2.76mm space between the two terminals; 16.87g weight.Discussion: A similar example in this British Museum collection is described as a penannular ring (accession number 2004,0601.1 penannular ring | British Museum). There are various such examples on the PAS database include HAMP-BE4072 - 2019T1091; WILT-299199 - 2021T306.These penannular rings belong to a class of artefact which has been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39;. It is not clear how these rings were used. In the past they were called &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; because they were thought to have been worn in the hair and they have been called &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; as they were thought to have been used as a proto-monetary exchange object and used in trade (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although use as hair decoration has been ruled out. However, the possibility remains that they were worn on the body and used as personal adornment (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196).Eogan&rsquo;s (2004) distribution shows that Bronze Age penannular rings are found in both Britain and Ireland and a small number have been found in northwest continental Europe. Finds recorded on the PAS database for England and Wales reflect a general bias towards southern Britain, with fewer recorded in Wales and northern England.Scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3a striped rings with silver gold alloy wire circumferentially inlaid&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex. These penannular rings, especially the gold sheet examples with stripes, are generally considered to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;800BC; Needham 2007, 33).Conclusion: Due to its age and precious metal content this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.Alyson TannerFinds Liaison Assistant for WiltshireSophie HawkeFinds Liaison Officer for WiltshirePortable Antiquities SchemeReferences:Armbruster, B.R. 2021.

The bars terminals narrow to form conical pointed terminals which have been bent into slight hooks resembling raptor beaks in form. The triple ribbed gold rings are each made of one piece and solid with one exception, R3, which is shaped thick foil. There are now several similar examples of twisted bar torcs with threaded penannular rings including Burton, Powys, Wales (PAS-5B1745 2004, W2) penannular bracelet; Windsor (BERK-A5FFE5, 2009 T755), twisted wire ornament and penannular rings; Granta Fen, Cambs, England (British Museum 1884,0520.3) torc and ring; Isle of Axholme, Lincs, England (British Museum 1880,0820.36),&nbsp; torc and ring and Skelly Co.

One end&nbsp;is original, with a rounded tip and neat triangular&nbsp;cross-section. From the rounded tip, the terminal flares slightly for c. 10mm and runs straight,&nbsp;before starting to coil. As it starts to curve,&nbsp;each face becomes concave so that&nbsp;the cross-section is Y-shaped, and the rod&nbsp;is then neatly twisted as well as bent into a coil. After two full turns the rod is apparently cut or broken.&nbsp;It is S-twisted (also called a left-hand twist), and the end of each flange, or arm of the Y, is polished or worn so that it is burred, or smooth and flat. The apparently broken&nbsp;or cut end also has some smoothly bent and worn areas. The fragment has a slightly pale, brownish colour.Dimensions: Overall diameter of coil, c. 11mm. Overall thickness of the coil, 6mm. Maximum diameter of the twisted rod, 2.4mm. Weight, 2.2g.Discussion: Gold torcs with twisted square&nbsp;or (more rarely) triangular cross-sections were popular in&nbsp;the Penard phase of the&nbsp;Middle Bronze Age,&nbsp;c. 1400-1100BC. The simplest form is the&nbsp;bar-twisted&nbsp;torc, where the rod is left with a square or triangular cross-section. When the corners of the square or triangle are&nbsp;extended into flanges, to produce a cross-shaped or Y-shaped cross-section, it is known as a flange-twisted&nbsp;torc; this example is perhaps on the border of both types (Hawkes 1961, fig. 3, nos. 2-4).&nbsp;Fragments of square bar-twisted or four-flanged torcs bent into small loops are recorded on the PAS database at&nbsp;GLO-2AF0AE and SOM-AA390A, and another (probably with four flanges) was found in 1961 in the Sporle hoard (Eogan 1967, 173, pl. 22.3). They vary in their gold content, some being fairly pure and others (e.g. ESS-D1D1E9) being only&nbsp;c. 75% gold.This object has some unusual features. Firstly, triangular bar-twisted torcs or three-flanged torcs are much less common than four-flanged examples, although a comparable three-flanged fragment is recorded at&nbsp;BUC-EF04B8.&nbsp; Secondly, torcs normally have&nbsp;terminals which flare outwards towards their ends, rather than taper as this one does. The&nbsp;terminal on this example is unusual, but&nbsp;can be compared with the&nbsp;terminals on a&nbsp;small Bronze Age gold twist-effect loop&nbsp;in the British Museum (OA.10875). Thirdly, twisted torcs&nbsp;are, according to Eogan (1967, 131), more often Z-twisted (also called right-hand twist). This example has an S twist, as do the small loops from the Sporle hoard,&nbsp;GLO-2AF0AE, and&nbsp;SOM-AA390A, and the short length of three-flange torc&nbsp;BUC-EF04B8.Date: Middle Bronze Age, 1400-1100 BC.",1,,"As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-09-28T00:00:00Z,2023-09-28T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,"North Norfolk","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1245806,images/awilliamsnorfolk/,1131699_652ff5b4e9d54.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2023-10-04T13:07:01Z,2025-01-17T10:07:23Z

The diameter of the terminal end is 6.17mm. The flat end is 6.5mm wide and 1.3mm thick.&nbsp;Discussion: The gold penannular bracelet is characteristic of the British Bronze Age. Objects like this typically have solid bodies and termini (Eogan, 1994, pp. 84-85). The fragment has its closest parallel to NMGW-E48854 on this database which is dated to the Late Bronze Age. That example has a circular cross section to the flared terminal and is similarly flattened beyond this point. Further parallels include IOW-7477D4, DOR-86B8B9 and Fragment 1 from CORN-705C14, which have been paralleled to an example from St Martin&#39;s, Isles of Scilly (Tyacke 1993). Further similar examples are also illustrated by Eogan (1994) from Caister on Sea Norfolk (Eogan 1994: pl 13, no. 1) and Berwickshire (Eogan 1994: pl 15, no. 6) all of which are also suggested to date to the Late Bronze Age. This is supported by a bracelet with an expanded terminal being found with a Late Bronze Age socketed axehead at Llanarmon-yn-I&acirc;l in Denbighshire (Green 1983).

It is probably a provincial type (Taylor 1970). The lunula was found in a stream. It may have been eroded from the bank or carried to the place of discovery by the water.&nbsp; It was rolled up when it was found and the finder unrolled it to see what it was. During the&nbsp;unrolling, one end became detached leaving the object in two pieces, but the terminal (or horn) of that end was already missing and has not been recovered.Description:The lunula weighs 75.6 grams and the additional fragment weighs 3.7 grams.&nbsp;It is flexible, making it difficult to measure precisely. It is approximately 180mm long, 170mm wide and the maximum width of the band is 65.4mm. The metal is about 0.25mm thick in most places.The complete terminal is on the end of a shaft which is 4.5mm wide and 1.3mm thick at the base of the terminal. The terminal is an oval sheet which is folded at each side of the shaft to form a three dimensional D shaped cap. The external face has incised decoration which is perhaps the best preserved of all the decoration on the lunula. It has a double incised line border, flanked by chevrons on both sides. The pattern is repeated in two straight lines across the terminal, on the same alignment as the shaft.&nbsp;Away from the terminal, the plane of the shaft changes by 90 degrees, and it widens and thins into the main face of the lunula. The angled surface expands to 65.4mm wide at the widest point. At the other end is an uneven break that matches the end of the separate piece. The lunula&nbsp;is 26.7mm wide at the break. The narrow end of the separate piece is also broken, and the other terminal is missing.The main part of the lunula is decorated, but the incised lines are very, very faint and only visible in a few places. There are at least 5 parallel border lines along the lower edge which are about 1.5mm away from each other, and the outermost one is 3.0mm - 3.8mm from the edge of the object. The middle two zones of the four created by these lines are cross hatched with incised evenly spaced transverse lines forming&nbsp;a ladder pattern. Inside the border lines are very faint traces of&nbsp;two incised zigzag lines. The pattern of border lines and ladder pattern appears to be repeated, perhaps without the internal chevrons, along the upper edge of the object, but it is only visible in one area.Near the broken end of the main piece is a band of patterning running across the surface of the lunula (38mm from the longest part of the broken&nbsp;end). This pattern is a double incised line flanked by a double zigzag line. It is only visible near the lower edge of the lunula.The centre of the lunula appears to be undecorated. At the more complete end, there are several areas of decoration. 151mm from the complete end is a straight line across the face of the lunula, with a zigzag line or double line alongside, closer to the terminal end. 138mm from the complete end is a zigzag line and then a curving line across the face. Further towards the terminal from that&nbsp;is an area of cross-hatching,&nbsp;and then a zigzag band which is&nbsp;113mm from the end. There are further zigzags at 85mm from the end, a ladder pattern at 78mm from the end, and next to that, two straight lines across the face and a zigzag line. No further decoration is visible closer to the terminal.&nbsp;The separate piece is sub-rectangular, but wider at one end. It is 43.5mm long, 25.2mm wide and 0.36mm thick. Incised parallel lines are visible along the outer edge and there are outward pointing chevrons along the inside of the edge lines. There is a band of ladder pattern running across the fragment at the wider end.&nbsp;This lunula is extremely worn, with the decoration being hardly visible. It is unclear whether this is owing to the findspot being in running water, which may have caused wear, or whether the lunula&rsquo;s decoration had been extensively rubbed (perhaps as an act of erasure prior to decommissioning for functional and/or symbolic reasons) before it was rolled up and deposited.&nbsp;Although the lunula is incomplete it is remarkably lop-sided and asymmetrical when compared to the majority of recorded lunulae, especially Irish examples. The left (broken) terminal is clearly longer than the right and the lunula would have appeared &lsquo;off kilter&rsquo; if ever worn. A similar feature is evident in the case of the lunula from Tarrant Valley, Dorset (DOR-2198F8). This unusual aspect is the subject of an ongoing study (Wilkin et al. in prep).&nbsp;Scientific analysis was undertaken on the detached piece&nbsp;by a friend of the finder: The results are:Time: 2.5 sec&nbsp;						Ag			7.04%			0.57%							Au			91.92%			1.16%							Cu			0.29%			0.14%			Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the lunula undertaken at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 91-93% gold, 6-8% silver, with traces of copper.&nbsp;Discussion:Lunulae are flat gold crescentic ornaments with spatulate terminals. According to Needham (2000) they may largely overlap primary Bell Beaker goldwork, and date from about&nbsp;2400-2000BC. There are only 4 other lunulae recorded on the PAS database:&nbsp;DUR-44A99A&nbsp;(terminal only),&nbsp;DOR-2198F8,&nbsp;DUR-A24C08&nbsp;and&nbsp;LANCUM-449151.DUR-A24C08 records that: &quot;Finds of Bronze Age lunulae are very rare from Britain although they are a slightly more common find in Ireland. A lunula was found near Thwing, East Yorkshire in 2012 (British Museum Reg 2015, 8031.1.a-b; Treasure case 2012 T811).&nbsp;Examples from Britain are known from the West of the country, there are three in the National Museum of Scotland (X.FE.1, X.FE.3 and X.FE.4) which are from Western Scotland and one (X.FE.2) which was found in Northern Scotland.&nbsp;There are also several Irish examples in the British Museum such as the Blessington lunula (WG.31) [...].&quot;DUR-44A99A reports that &quot;Lunulae are described as crescent-shaped flat plates with a sub-rectangular expansion at each end constituting the terminals, the latter being usually turned at right angles to the plane of the body and thus enabling the collar to be fastened (Eogan 1994, p30). The excellent condition of many recovered examples indicates they were cherished and cared for objects, possibly worn to symbolise power or rank and perhaps used in religious practices (ibid, 34). It is suggested that since few are found in association with graves lunulae may have been owned collectively by groups or clans rather than being personal property, while the style and form of decoration is indicative of close links to the Beaker period in the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age, c.2400-2000BC (Taylor 1980, p28; Eogan 1994, p33). Wiseman and Roberts, (2014, p359) characterise the period &nbsp;as the &ldquo;chalcolithic / early Bronze Age (c. 2500-1500 Bc) phase of gold-working in England and Wales&rdquo; where sheet metal-working techniques were used to produce a range of objects. Lunulae were themselves manufactured by the beating out of an ingot or rod, demonstrating considerable skill, with the thickness of the resulting sheet, applied decoration, and geographical distribution determining the tripartite classification of the lunula as defined by Taylor (1980, p25; Eogan 1994, p30).&quot;Taylor (1970) has created three classes of lunula and this example is likely to be of the provincial linear type. The provincial type of lunula is made of slightly thicker foil and is narrower than the classical type of which the Blessington lunula (https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_WG-31) is an example. Having said that, the thickness of this example is approaching that of some Classical types, and is thinner than some provincial types. However, allowing the for extremely worn state of this example, and the findspot, it is more likely to be a provincial type.DUR-44A99A goes on to say &quot;Classical and Unaccomplished lunulae are the most numerous known, and are finely (often symmetrically) decorated with the sheets of gold beaten out very thinly. The majority have been found in Ireland, with only a handful of Classical examples being recovered in Cornwall; no Unaccomplished lunulae have been found outside of Ireland (Eogan 1994, p30-1). Provincial lunulae, as the name suggests, &ldquo;form a cohesive group by their geographical isolation from the other two&rdquo; being found (with isolated exceptions) solely outside of Ireland (Taylor 1980, p33 and 40). More specifically, Provincial forms are also thicker, thus more rigid, and more sparely decorated. Taylor (ibid) classifies two decorative variations: the dot-line, and the linear.&quot;",1,,"This object is prehistoric and is made of gold, and thus appears to meet the requirements of the 1996 Treasure Act.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-08-11T00:00:00Z,2023-08-11T00:00:00Z,"Yorkshire and the Humber","North Yorkshire",Craven,"Restricted access",Grassington,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure",,1241520,images/ikw1945/,1125058_6500c0d234626.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,SWYOR,2023-08-16T10:23:33Z,2025-08-22T13:56:57Z

It is folded over at one end and then back on itself, which would add another 10mm to the overall length if straightened. The other end is not folded. The finder has already straightened this out somewhat, it originally had more bends in it. It is not broken though and the shape at the ends suggest that it is complete. There is some distortion to the shape but no breaks.Dimensions: Diameter: Length 65mm long and 4.5mm wide, up to 1mm in thickness.

This includes a gold securing strip, with perforated folded terminals, from a gold armlet or cuff found in the hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire, and illustrated in Savory (1980: 195, fig.47, no.1), which is now dated from the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC. The colouring and shape also closely resemble an example excavated near Llanwit Major in 2008 (NMGW-09A1A5), now in the collection of Amgueddfa Cymru, which was found in association with fragments of middle Bronze Age pottery dated to 1500-1150 BC (Middle Bronze Age gold strip - Collections Online | Museum Wales). This example also has rounded and&nbsp;which have been folded but it has holes pierced at these ends, which the example under discussion does not have. Stylistically though both examples are very similar and there is no reason not to conclude that the example here is not of the same period.Conclusion: The object appears to have a composition of more than 10% precious metal and is probably at least 300 years old; it therefore meets the criteria for consideration as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-08-05T00:00:00Z,2023-08-05T00:00:00Z,"North West",Cumbria,Allerdale,"Restricted access","Near Dean",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","With finder",1237290,images/paulinemclarke/,GoldSemail07082023DH.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,LANCUM,2023-08-14T09:19:23Z,2025-02-27T11:59:17Z

The sheet has been folded four times in a concertina style and the loop is folded over on to the sheet. The object appears undecorated. A cross shaped indentation is present where the loop meets the body of the object though this appears to be the result of damage rather than a deliberate addition to the object. Dimensions:Length: 10.6mm; Width: 21.8mm; Thickness: 4.3mm; Weight: 2.1g.Discussion: Similar objects have been recorded as GLO-92912E (2019 T537), LON-FF7E65 (2018 T386) and BERK-F548E6 (2015 T72). This class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain (Taylor 1980: 22; Needham and Sheridan 2014: 907). They are usually associated with burials and are very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2500-2200 BC. Such objects are referred to as &#39;basket ornaments&rsquo; with the initial suggestion that they formed earrings (Butler 1963: 188; Eogan 1994: 15) but have also been suggested as hair ornaments (Sherratt 1986) to be slid on to plaits. They are in any case personal ornaments and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period.

This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3d gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.A number of this type of penannular ring have been reported to the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;and declared treasure in recent years, including&nbsp;PAS-011055&nbsp;and&nbsp;BM-BEFAF7.CAM-5B1D08 also has an iron core and is therefore given a later date range of c.1150-800 BC.&nbsp;Conclusion:&nbsp;It is therefore likely that this object was at least 300 years old at the time of discovery and, as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, therefore constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-06-21T00:00:00Z,,,Thurrock,Thurrock,"Restricted access","Near Corringham and Fobbing",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,1234597,images/lrogerson/,ESS8F6336.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,ESS,2023-07-20T09:54:11Z,2024-09-24T09:21:20Z

It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange (see debate in Armbruster 2021: 191-196).

The lines are all parallel to each other, possibly made with a comb or similar tool.Length 96.91 mm, width 15.1 mm, thickness 0.84 mm and weight 8.18 g.Similar multi-grooved strips of a Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48). There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar objects have also been recorded on the PAS database and reported as Treasure; LVPL-BBA759 (2022 T1057) WMID-804501 (2021 T768) and LIN-946F12 (2011 T459). Therefore, this item is more than 300 years old and composed of more than 10% precious metal, and therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.References: Palmer, N. 1980.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 23.7 mm&nbsp;(thickness: 2.5&nbsp;mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (10.1&nbsp;mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 61.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. Casting &#39;flaws&#39; or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.It measures 128.4 mm&nbsp;in length, maximum width at the blade is 61.2&nbsp;mm, width at the butt is 23.7 mm&nbsp;and it has a maximum thickness of 10.1&nbsp;mm.

It is C-shaped in plan comprised of three circular-sectioned penannular rings soldered together. The terminals are of an inconsistent width, creating an oblique aperture.Diameter: 14.2mm; Width: 6.4mm; Thickness: 1.3mm; Weight: 3.38g.Discussion: The form is consistent with other examples processed through the Treasure Act including 2021 T762 (Gard 2021) and 2012 T165 (Smith 2012) each of which is dated to the Middle Bronze Age.Meeks et. al. (2008, 13) note that &ldquo;although small, penannular rings are amongst the most common items of gold to survive from the British Bronze Age, they remain one of the most problematic classes of prehistoric artefacts as they generally lack good contexts or associations with other classes of metalwork, making them difficult to date accurately&rdquo;. These penannular rings also take several forms with those that are thicker than this example (such as OXON-FFD016, 2020 T77) given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997).However, this multibed form made of relatively narrow cords has parallels found in at least three Middle Bronze Age contexts. The first, the Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745 &ndash; Welsh Treasure case 04:02), includes a composite gold penannular ring formed from three round-sectioned wires which have been fused together, with simple clipped or cut terminals. The Cirencester Hoard (BM-28B710 &ndash; 2004 T416) includes two double penannular rings and a fragment of a third. Finally, the Granta Fen hoard (British Museum Accession No. 1884,0520) includes several multistranded penannular rings looped around a gold bracelet which was found with an incomplete rapier. Each of these hoards have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c1300-1150 BC) based on the range of chronologically diagnostic artefacts within them which would suggest this form may be dated to this period although a Late Bronze Age date should not be excluded.The appearance of these is then associated with the onset of the Bronze Age &lsquo;ornament horizon&rsquo; dating to circa 1400-1100 BC, congruent with the Taunton to Penard metalwork phases of the Bronze Age (Roberts 2007: 7).Conclusion: The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. As a result, in terms of both age and precious metal content, it satisfies the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.References: Eogan, G.

The terminals appear to have been raised from&nbsp;the joining bar or &#39;bow&#39; (which is circular in cross section and tapers towards the terminal cones) by hammering (planishing) and small hammer marks are visible on the surfaces of both cones. Armbruster (2021, 210) has recently argued that &#39;handle&#39; or &#39;bow&#39; of this type of object could have been cast straight until the terminals were hammered/raised before being bent.There are light scratches (possibly traces of wear) across the body of the object, although these disappear close to the very edge of the terminals, suggesting they were possibly covered during original use (also see Wilde 1862, 60).&nbsp;One side of the bar shows a long burring which appears to be modern in origin.

Eogan (1994, 142-45, fig, 40) records 19 dress fasteners from Britain and 82 from Ireland. I am unaware of any additional British finds made since Eogan published his study in 1994. One additional Irish example has been discovered since 1994, in 2013, in Ballycullen, Co. Dublin (National Museum of Ireland registration number 2013:368) (M. Cahill pers comm.). The Ellastone find is therefore the twentieth of its type and the seventh found in England to date. The geographically closest discoveries were made on the northern side of the Peak District, in North Yorkshire: two found together from &lsquo;near Rippon&rsquo; in 1780 and one seemingly found on its own around 1815, near the lodge of Swinton Park (Swinton Estate) which weighed c.164g (Way 1849, 61). There are also single examples from Norfolk, Kent (a terminal/fragment) and Cornwall (Eogan 1994, 142-45). The dimension and weight of the Staffordshire find is very similar to an example from Islay, Scotland, in the collections of the British Museum (registration number 1920,0316.1; https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1920-0316-1)In terms of function, these objects could have been used to fasten cloth and clothing (Hakwes &amp; Clarke 1963, fig. 52), although in appearance they resemble (and may have been inspired by) contemporary bracelets with&nbsp;expanded terminals.Other, notable, later Bronze Age finds have been made in close vicinity, including a pair of late style palstaves (Treasure case 2023 T545) of possible Wilburton to Ewart Park date (c.1150-800 BC).&nbsp;Conclusion:&nbsp;This object is over 300 years old and is made of precious metal (more than 10%). It therefore appears to meet the requirements of the 1996 Treasure Act.References:Armbruster, B.R. 2021. Les ors de l&#39;Europe Atlantique a l&#39;&Acirc;ge du Bronze: technologie et ateliers.

Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating, however, burials in Belgium, northeast France, and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing. Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores but there is no evidence visually that this is the case with this example.

Typically, gold bars were a feature in their manufacture, such that the majority, like this example, have solid bodies and termini, and decoration was not common in Britain (Eogan, 1994, p84-5).Particularly similar examples with square cross sections and slightly expanded terminals include examples from the from Sporle with Palgrave hoard (Taylor 1988: EA86), Morvah Hoard (Pearce 1983: case 108) and an example from the British Museum Collections from Towednack, Cornwall (Accession number 1932,0511.7 f). This is described as a gold bar which may have been an unfinished bracelet, dating to c. 1400-1100 BC.Other similar, complete bracelets have been found as part of hoards at Beachy Head, Sussex (Eogan, 1994, Plate 10, p170) and at Stonehill, Lanark (Eogan, 1994, Plate 15, p175). Further examples on the PAS include 2022T980 (SUR-3DE17A), from Guildford, Surrey and 2004T490 (BM-25EFE8), from Roxby cum Risby, North Lincolnshire, although these are incomplete.The above examples predominantly suggest a Middle to Late Bronze Age date. Within a radius of 1km of this findspot, no other finds at all are listed on the PAS database, however, there are several bowl barrows dating from the Late Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age (c.2400-1000 BC), in the vicinity, as well as a Middle Bronze Age field system. A Middle to Late Bronze Age date can also be supported by the find&rsquo;s context.Conclusion: The find contains a minimum of 10% gold and is over 300 years old in date. It therefore qualifies as Treasure under the provisions of the Treasure Act 1996.Alix Smith, FLA WiltshireSophie Hawke, FLO WiltshirePortable Antiquities SchemeReferences:Eogan, G.

Their appearance in Britain most likely coincides with the beginning of the &#39;Ornament Horizon&#39; (c. 1400-1100&nbsp;BC), a new tradition of gold ornaments which coincides with the early Taunton to the later Penard metalwork phases for England and Wales (Roberts 2007: 7). This ring, therefore, can be generally dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400-1140&nbsp;BC).A date of 1300-1150 BC is therefore suggested for this object.&nbsp;Conclusion:&nbsp; It is therefore likely that this object was at least 300 years old at the time of discovery and, as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, therefore constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-02-27T00:00:00Z,2023-02-27T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Essex,Tendring,"Restricted access",Beaumont-cum-Moze,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Declared Treasure but returned to Finder as Museum unable to acquire",,1222283,images/lrogerson/,ESSF1E21D.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,ESS,2023-03-01T09:42:57Z,2025-07-04T09:20:44Z

Finds recorded on the PAS database for England and Wales reflect a general bias towards southern Britain, with very few recorded in the West Midlands, Wales and northern England. It is the first example of the striped type to be recorded on the PAS database in Staffordshire.A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008).

However, burials in Belgium, north-east France, and the Netherlands, in addition to Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 BC (Eogan 1997). While in recent years, evidence for earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs 17.3-4) these penannular rings, especially the gold sheet examples with stripes, are generally considered to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;800BC; Needham 2007, 33).Conclusion: The penannular ring is substantially precious in nature and is older than 300 years. It therefore falls within the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996 and should be considered to be Treasure.References: Armbruster, B.R. 2021.

The torc would have been manufactured from a cast bar into which four longitudinal cuts were made. These were then worked to create an X-shaped cross-section and finally the bar was twisted to create a spiral effect. Only a small portion of the original object survives. The fragment terminates in clean but very worn breaks at either end which are likely to have been cut, it has then been bent into a small loop with the ends overlapping. Gold flange twisted torcs have been dated typologically to the Taunton (c.1400-1250&nbsp;BC), or more probably the Penard (c. 1300-1150&nbsp;BC), metalwork phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007), when twisting and flange twisting bars and ribbons of gold were common techniques in Britain (Murgia et al. forthcomingTaylor 1980). Torcs of this style are most common in southern England and East Anglia, but do occur elsewhere in Wales and central Britain (Roberts 2007). Deliberately cut fragments like this occur relatively often in hoards (e.g. the Salcombe hoard from Devon and the Fittleworth hoard from West Sussex) and occasionally as stray finds (e.g. treasure case 2011 T501).Similar examples on the database include: SOM-AA390A, IOW-C0C054, BH-149F18, HAMP-C8DC02 and SF-FD97BA.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South West",Gloucestershire,Cotswold,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1212221,images/kadams/,GLO2AF0AE.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,GLO,2023-01-26T16:49:14Z,2024-11-11T10:28:13Z

It is C-shaped in plan comprised of three circular-sectioned penannular rings soldered together. Each terminates in a straight and even terminal.Diameter: 13.3mm; Thickness: 2.8mm; Weight: 6.30g.Discussion: The form is consistent with other examples processed through the Treasure Act including 2021 T762 (Gard 2021) and 2012 T165 (Smith 2012) each of which is dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Meeks et. al. (2008, 13) note that &ldquo;although small, penannular rings are amongst the most common items of gold to survive from the British Bronze Age, they remain one of the most problematic classes of prehistoric artefacts as they generally lack good contexts or associations with other classes of metalwork, making them difficult to date accurately&rdquo;. These penannular rings also take several forms with those that are thicker than this example (such as OXON-FFD016, 2020 T77) given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, this multibed form made of relatively narrow cords has parallels found in at least three Middle Bronze Age contexts. The first, the Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745 &ndash; Welsh Treasure case 04:02), includes a composite gold penannular ring formed from three round-sectioned wires which have been fused together, with simple clipped or cut terminals. The Cirencester Hoard (BM-28B710 &ndash; 2004 T416) includes two double penannular rings and a fragment of a third. Finally, the Granta Fen hoard (British Museum Accession No. 1884,0520) includes several multistranded penannular rings looped around a gold bracelet which was found with an incomplete rapier. Each of these hoards have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c1300-1150 BC) based on the range of chronologically diagnostic artefacts within them which would suggest this form may be dated to this period although a Late Bronze Age date should not be excluded.The appearance of these is then associated with the onset of the Bronze Age &lsquo;ornament horizon&rsquo; dating to circa 1400-1100 BC, congruent with the Taunton to Penard metalwork phases of the Bronze Age (Roberts 2007: 7).Conclusion: The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. As a result, in terms of both age and precious metal content, it satisfies the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.References: Eogan, G.

The ring is circular in both plan and cross-section, with flat, slanted terminals. The gold plating is flaking at the terminals and the copper-alloy core is slightly visible. The gap between the terminals is approximately 1.65 mm. There is no sign of banding in differential shades of gold, this being a common form of decoration on similar rings.&nbsp;These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800&nbsp;BC). They have been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008), but their function remains uncertain (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196). It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.&nbsp;Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating. However, burials in Belgium, north-east France, and The Netherlands, in addition to Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 BC (Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, evidence for earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, this penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC).

The butt is missing.The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid in shape.&nbsp;The patina at the break matches with the rest of the axe suggesting the break occurred in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the middle to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (8.9 mm). The sides of the blade expand slightly to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 32.0&nbsp;mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. The blade facet has been heavily abraded and is virtually no longer visible, however the top and bottom of the blade do slope gently down to the edge. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe.The object measures 33.4 mm&nbsp;in length. The width at the break&nbsp;is 18.6&nbsp;mm. The break&nbsp;has a thickness of 8.9&nbsp;mm,&nbsp;and the blade is 2.5&nbsp;mm&nbsp;thick. The axehead weighs 32.2 g.The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour with a much abraded or corroded patina. Traces of a light green patina, suggesting corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age (or possibly even the Copper Age). This example fits best into the copper axes and early bronze axes. The form of the axe is comparable to Type Castletown Roche/Pitlochry (outlined by Schmidt and Burgess p 22-23, Plate 1, No 5). These axes fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The ring is oval in plan and cross section. It appears to have a core made of copper alloy which is covered by a outer surface made of fold. This is decorated with narrow stripes of yellow and paler gold, visible on the inner surface of the hoop; additionally, the paler stripes show black tarnish inside the hoop.

This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3d gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.A number of this type of penannular ring have been reported to the PAS and declared treasure in recent years, including PAS-011055, ESS-5DF4B7 and BM-BEFAF7.",,,"References:Armbruster, B.R. 2021.

Two closer examples with a tab extending from its narrow edge is also recorded LEIC-448088 (2006T154) Each of these objects are referred to as &#39;basket ornaments&rsquo; with the initial suggestion that they formed earrings (Butler 1963: 188; Eogan 1994: 15; Russel et al. 1990: 166) but have also been suggested as hair ornaments (Sherratt 1986; 1987) to be slid on to plaits. They are in any case personal ornaments and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period.The majority of these have tangs extending from their longest side. This is then notable for having a tang extending from its narrowest edge. This is identical to objects illustrated by Taylor (1980: pl.3h-j) and Armbruster (2021: fig. 107) which both group these with similar basket shaped objects. Needham&rsquo;s reappraisal of the forms of these items has placed this shape to Group A (Needham 2011: 383, fig 44) and list six known examples and one further possible example (ibid: Table 22). &nbsp;At the time of Taylor&rsquo;s summary only one example of this form was known from the British Isles at Dacomet (Taylor 1980: 22) &ndash; now known as Benraw (O&rsquo;Connor 2004: 2008) and this was suggested as originating from the Iberian peninsula. This is now disputed (O&rsquo;Connor 2004: 208) and when combined with further examples found from Gilmorton (Needham and Sheridan 2014: 906-7) may suggest a local origin.Regardless of origin these items are also suggested to date to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain and into the beaker period (Taylor 1980: 22; Needham and Sheridan 2014: 907). These are usually associated with burials and are very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC.It is the first example of its type recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme and is listed as a &#39;Find of Note&#39;.ConclusionIn conclusion, this object constitutes a prima facie case of treasure by consisting of more than 10% precious metal content in that it is gold and is of an antiquity greater than 300 years",1,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-10-29T00:00:00Z,,"East Midlands",Lincolnshire,"East Lindsey","Restricted access","Near Spilsby",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure",,1206022,images/rod/,LINE5327B.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,LIN,2022-11-11T13:50:31Z,2025-12-16T16:10:33Z

At one narrow end these wires end in smooth rounded terminals but at their opposite narrow terminals they are truncated by rough transverse break indicating these only represent a portion of the pieces&rsquo; original circumference. Similarly, while one wire&rsquo;s outside edge is smooth and rounded, the second wire&rsquo;s outside edge is rough with a slight lip indicating it is likely further strands of wire were soldered to this piece which have now been lost.In profile the ring is an irregular curve indicating that it has been warped out of shape since deposition.The ring retains a gold lustre to its surface.Dimensions: In its current state the ring is 16.8mm long, 5.1mm wide, 2.0mm thick and weighs 1.72 grams.Discussion and Dating:&nbsp; There are a number of parallels on both the PAS database for individual rings of this type.&nbsp; These include ESS-0068F1 (2005 T495), SWYOR-B50B30 (2015 T364), HAMP-SA5729 (2015 T586) and LEIC-88F086 (2021 T762), all of which are made up of three strands of wire. Penannular rings with more than three strands are less frequently recorded on the PAS database although an 11-strand ring from Kent has been recorded as SUR-1B64F5 (2012 T659).&nbsp; A 6-strand ring can also be found on the British Museum&rsquo;s Collections online (WG.19), which is an Irish example with a broad date of c1300-750BC, from Arboe, County Tyrone.Meeks et. al. (2008, 13)&nbsp; notes that &ldquo;although small, penannular rings are amongst the most common items of gold to survive from the British Bronze Age, they remain one of the most problematic classes of prehistoric artefacts as they generally lack good contexts or associations with other classes of metalwork, making them difficult to date accurately&rdquo;. These objects also take several forms with those that are thicker than this example (such as OXON-FFD016, 2020T77) given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997).However, this multibed form made of relatively narrow cords has parallels found in at least three Middle Bronze Age contexts. The first, the Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745 &ndash; Welsh Treasure case 04:02), includes a composite gold penannular ring formed from three round-sectioned wires which have been fused together, with simple clipped or cut terminals. The Cirencester Hoard (BM-28B710 &ndash; 2004 T416) includes two double penannular rings and a fragment of a third. Finally, the Granta Fen hoard (British Museum Accession No. 1884,0520) includes several multistranded penannular rings looped around a gold bracelet which was found with an incomplete rapier. Each of these hoards have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c1300-1150 BC) based on the range of chronologically diagnostic artefacts within them which would suggest this form may be dated to this period.Conclusion: The ring appears to consist of more than 10% precious metal and at the time of finding was more than 300 years old, it thus qualifies as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-06T00:00:00Z,2022-11-06T00:00:00Z,"South East",Oxfordshire,Cherwell,"Restricted access","Shipton-on-Cherwell and Thrupp CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1210772,images/edwardcaswelloxon/,2022T1110.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,OXON,2022-11-09T08:46:56Z,2024-10-25T09:14:57Z

It weighs 145.65 grams.The axe is a mid to dark brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. One side has a patch of light green corrosion where the surface patina is damaged, possibly from abrasion caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the original surface detail.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

Now flattened and squashed, the piece is comprised of a cylindrical piece of sheet metal folded in on itself multiple times. The join is overlapping rather than soldered. The external face of the object is decorated with incised horizontal grooves running around the circumference. They cover the entire length of the piece.Length: 15.7mm; Width: 5.6mm; Thickness: 2.4mm; Weight: 0.60g.Discussion: The piece was likely used as an item of jewellery most likely a bead.It is similar to other objects on the database recorded as beads such as 2019T513 (GLO-FE959E), 2019T316 (LEIC-47D0C2) and 2018T876 (SF-AC2907). Their use as beads on a necklace is well illustrated by a complete example in the British Museum (BM 1853,0926.2). Similarly formed beads are also pictured by Armbruster (2021: 133, fig 138-9) which are suggested in Britain to date from the earliest Bronze Age (ibid: 131) to the end of the Bronze Age (ibid: 132) with those in France tending to be primarily Late Bronze Age (see Elu&egrave;re 1982, 30-31, 168-171). However, stylistically, it has much in common with other Bronze Age sheet metal gold objects often recorded as ribbons including 2021T434 (LEIC-28D5B5), 2007T672 (WAW-C0C0B3) and 2012T577 (ESS-C13B97) attributed to the Early Bronze Age. An Early Bronze Age date would be supported by an in-context that was found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC. One further example on the database has also been found in a hoard from Cornwall 2020T222 (CORN-705C14) which has been dated to the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 cal BC following Roberts et al. 2013).Consequently, a broad Early to Late Bronze Age date is suggested here.Conclusion: The object contains a minimum of 10% of precious metal and is over 300 years old. As a result, in terms of both age and precious metal content, it satisfies the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. Authors: Dr Phil Hughes, SSCAS, November 2022.

Each ring is sub-circular (oval) in cross-section and&nbsp;sub-circular (oval) when viewed in plan.

The gap between the terminals is c.2.69mm. It weighs 7.08g. Each of the two individual bands are of equal dimensions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion: Penannular rings are a relatively common class of artefact reported through the Treasure Act with bi-partite examples including SOM-4D34ED&nbsp;(2018T14); LIN-9DC2D1&nbsp;(&nbsp;2020T693) and SUSS-42C974&nbsp;(2021T174). The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Eogan 1994; 1997). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating, however, burials in Belgium, northeast France, and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing. Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores and the hole and possible void in the terminal suggest this may be the case in this example.&nbsp;ReferencesEogan, G. 1997. &lsquo;Hair-rings&rsquo; and European Late Bronze Age society.

The rod is bent, gently curving to 90&deg;&#39;s at one end, and both ends have been cut or clipped at an oblique angle, possibly with shears or nippers. The surfaces are covered with scratches but two small parallel knicks near one end may be test marks to check the purity of the metal. The metal&nbsp;has a yellow gold colour.Measurements: length: 45.18mm; thickness of rod: 4.86mm to 4.43mm and weight: 12.18g.Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis&nbsp;indicated a surface composition of approximately 78-80% gold, 15-17% silver, the rest being copper. Discussion:&nbsp;fragments of silver or gold&nbsp;that have been deliberately cut up, often from items of jewellery such as armrings or bracelets, are&nbsp;often attributed to a Viking date. Similar examples in silver that have passed through the treasure process include:&nbsp;DENO-705A57&nbsp;(2013T8) and a decorated octagonal rod&nbsp;DUR-DFF172&nbsp;(2017-T965) and a gold circular sections rod&nbsp;SF-233CD7&nbsp;(2007T651). However, while gold bar ingots have been attributed to the Viking period the evidence for this dating is thin; the Viking, bullion economy was based on silver and gold is uncommon (Graham-Campbell, 2011, 151&mdash;53). Viking gold finds usually consist of rings although the Hebrides (North Uist?) hoard contained bar-ingot and &lsquo;finger&rsquo; ingot fragments (Graham-Campbell, 1995, Pl.50a). The assumption that bar-ingots are Viking is based on comparison with silver ingots which are commonly found in hoards and must be challenged.Instead, this fragment may be dated to the Bronze Age. Facetted bar fragments are known from at least two gold hoard dated to this period at as at Fitzleroi Farm, Fittleworth (British museum Accession No. 1996,0902.3) and Cirencester (2004 T416).References: Graham-Campbell, J. 2011, The Cuerdale Hoard &ndash; and related Viking Age silver from Britain and Ireland in the British Museum, British MuseumGraham-Campbell, J. 1995, The Viking-Age gold and silver of Scotland (AD850-1100) National Museum of Scotland.",,,"The object contains more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old at the time of finding.

The finder left the soil inside the penannular bracelet for (partial) micro-excavation at the British Museum to enable the decoration and extent of the objects to be fully documented. The area around the hoard was thoroughly searched with a metal detector but no further metal finds were made, suggesting that the hoard was a lone deposit. A magnetometry survey was subsequently carried out at the location to establish whether&nbsp;there was any evidence of other archaeological features indicating past settlement activity in the field.&nbsp;The survey found evidence of possible archaeology including a possible enclosure within which there appeared to be an area of disturbed ground. However, this feature appeared to be relatively modern and not dated to the Bronze Age and therefore not associated with the find. The full report is available from the Wiltshire&nbsp;HER.In the same area is ST98NW641 which is recorded on the HER as a ring ditch visible on aerial photographs. It may be the site of a round barrow or a tree ring as it is within parkland. The only other Bronze Age find recorded on the PAS database from the same area, approximately 20m to the north, is an awl NMGW-8C8316, probably dating to Late Bronze Age.Catalogue of Finds:	Gold bracelet: A penannular corrugated bracelet made from sheet gold, sub-circular in plan. It is made from a band of beaten sheet metal (gold) decorated with four embossed ribs, evenly spaced. In the external furrows of the corrugated sheet, is lined with dot (pointill&eacute;) decoration. The upper and lower edges of the bracelet have been turned inwards to form its edges. Both terminals have hooks formed to fasten the bracelet neatly, like a clasp. Some portions of the bracelet are now slightly crushed, possibly due to soil pressure or pre-depositional damage. Dimensions:&nbsp;Penannular bracelet: diameter (max): 65.6mm; height: 41.0mm; thickness: 1.5mm; Circumference (slight distortion): 190mm; weight (incl soil) 165.0g; revised weight (without soil): 32.5g 	Gold bracelet/armlet: A folded, flattened armlet. This bracelet is tightly coiled. It is made from a band of beaten sheet metal (gold) and has been divided horizontally into four sections, each filled with repeating vertically incised/scored lines. The upper and lower edges of the sheet appear to have been bent inwards to form defined rims. On the reverse of the bracelet, the terminal end&nbsp;has been folded back to form a clasp for fastening. The bracelet appears to have been deliberately folded and flattened prior to deposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object x-radiographed to observe structure and condition. Excavation dirt was removed from both ends of the bracelet to reveal the edges in order to estimate its circumference. The dirt was removed using water and IMS 50:50. The more visible of the two edges was measured using cotton string.Dimensions: Bracelet 2: height: 45.1mm; width: 34.8mm; thickness: 12.4mm; weight (incl soil): 54.49g (following partial cleaning): 53.2g; Length (estimated): 394mm 	Gold bracelet/armlet:&nbsp; Folded, flattened bracelet/armlet. This bracelet is coiled into a&nbsp;spiral of five layers. It is made from a band of sheet metal (gold). The outer decoration is divided into three horizontal panels. The middle section is defined by a embossed narrow ribs. Below this rib is an apparently plain panel, followed by a further embossed horizontal rib. The panels on either side are decorated with vertical lines incised or scored into the gold (cf. bracelet no. 2).&nbsp;The upper and lower edges of the sheet appear to have been bent inwards to form defined rims. On the reverse of the bracelet, the&nbsp;terminal end has been folded in on itself to form a clasp.Object x-radiographed to look at structure and condition. Some dirt was removed from both ends of the bracelet to reveal the edges to estimate its circumference. The dirt was removed using water and IMS 50:50 on cotton swabs under microscopy. The visible (uncrushed) end of the bracelet was cleaned to reveal detail. Dimensions: height: 38.0mm; width: 38.6mm; thickness: 8.2mm; weight (incl soil): 21.84g; weight (after partial cleaning): 21.4g; Uncrushed end Circumference was measured using cotton at 305mm.An exact parallel for the gold penannular bracelet (No. 1) could not be found. However, this bracelet resembles broad sheet penannular corrugated bracelets with coiled terminals: one (part of a mixed copper alloy and goldwork hoard) from Thrisk, North Yorkshire (Needham 1990, fig. 3), a pair from Gelderston, Norfolk, one from the Derrinboy hoard, Co. Offaly (Eoghan, 1994, pl. XI and XII; Taylor, 1980, figs 29a-e), and the broad ribbed bracelet from Dysart, Co. Westmeath (Eoghan, 1994, 60 Fig. 24f). The dating of these objects is difficult to pin down. The bracelet from Thrisk, North Yorkshire, was found in association with a gold ring, three bronze spearheads, a bronze ferrule and a bronze tanged knife. Needham (1990, 263-4) dates the hoard to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1150 &ndash; 975 BC), based on the lunate opening spearhead. A corrugated bracelet/armlet was associated with bracelets and &lsquo;dress fasteners&rsquo; from Heights of Brae, Easter Ross, Scotland, of Late Bronze Age date (c.1000 &ndash; 800 BC), although it should be noted that the bracelet/armlet was annular rather than penannular (Cowie 1988, fig. 33). It is also difficult to closely parallel bracelets Nos. 2-3. Although their decoration differs in some details to bracelet/armlet No. 1 (and, indeed, to each other in terms of the detail of the decorative scheme), they are comparable to it in terms of their clasp fastening. The closest parallels for the pair are therefore the same as bracelet/armlet No. 1. It is notable that the circumference of objects Nos. 2-3 differs considerably from No. 1: 394mm and 305mm compared to 190mm. This suggests they may have had different functions, the larger circumference perhaps indicative of decoration intended for a larger arm or worn further up the arm (i.e. not a bracelet). Although use in alternative ways is possible (e.g. as part of head-gear). Nos. 2-3 were treated in comparable ways (and differently to object No. 1): deliberately folded and flattened before deposition. This was possibly to fit the hoard inside an organic container (no trace remaining), as appears to be the case with the Crow Down goldwork hoard, Berkshire (Varndell et al. 2007). &nbsp;A number of examples of gold strips and bracelets being folded prior to deposition are recorded on the PAS database, which have been through the Treasure process,&nbsp; including 2018T164 (SOM-A4086B), a rolled gold bracelet from Piddletrenthide, Dorset, dating to the Middle Bronze Age; 2020T480 (DOR-86B8B9) a Late Bronze Age gold coiled strip or bar from Hilton, Dorset; and 2022T736 (OXON-A33005) a fragment of Bronze Age gold bracelet from Pyrton, Oxfordshire.The pointill&eacute; decoration in the furrows of the corrugated decoration of bracelet No. 1 is a notable feature of earlier (Early Bronze Age) armlets/bracelets, including Lockington types, although these have an annular form (cf. Needham in Hughes 2000). It is also a feature of the Woolaston bracelets, which combine that technique with embossing (Treasure case 2013 T805), although they are considerably smaller in size and have hook-shaped terminals rather than clasps terminals featured on the Malmesbury find (and on bracelet/armlet Nos. 2-3). It seems most probable that the bracelet (and indeed the hoard) is therefore Late Bronze Age in date. Conclusion: The objects have a minimum of 10% precious metal and are all over 300 years old. Consequently, the hoard qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Authors:Sophie HawkeFinds Liaison Officer for WiltshirePortable Antiquities SchemeNeil WilkinCurator, Dept Britain, Europe &amp; Prehistory The British Museum References: Burnett, L., 2018, PAS record for SOM-A4086B Bronze Age gold bracelet Record ID: SOM-A4086B - BRONZE AGE bracelet (finds.org.uk)Caswell, E., 2022, PAS record for OXON-A33005 Bronze Age gold bracelet fragment Record ID: OXON-A33005 - BRONZE AGE ribbon (finds.org.uk)Cowie, T. 1988, Magic Metal.

However, in general, objects were found widely disposed around and above the body, mostly in clusters.The gold finds from the second grave (1236) only came to light when soil inside the jaw of the skeleton (again of an adult male: the &lsquo;Archer&rsquo;s Companion) was being cleaned away in the laboratory. One ornament was inside the other. A number of other finds occurred in the grave.GRAVE 1289DescriptionFor logistical reasons it was decided to leave the whole assemblage at the head-quarters of the Wessex Trust, where it will receive the standard post-excavation care and study. The compiler of this report visited to inspect all the material from grave 1289 with the exception of the flints recovered during processing of soil samples (items 17 &amp; 18).By way of summary, the following were present:						&nbsp;						Material									Objects									Nos of artefacts													1									Gold									Coiled sheet-gold plates with a spur or tang - often known as &gt;basket earrings=, or &gt;basket ornaments=									2													2									Copper									Tanged knife-daggers									3													3									Pottery									580 sherds of pottery, representing at least five Beaker vessels									5													4									Shale									Belt-ring									1													5									Stone									Archer=s wristguards									2													6									Stone									Anvil-cum-polishing stone, often known as &gt;cushion stone=									1													7									Stone									Small, elongated oval stone - probably a fossil									1													8									Stone									Chalk-bearing fossils									20													9									Iron pyrites									Two complete nodules and 17 fragments from at least one			&nbsp;more nodule									3													10									Flint									Barbed-and-tanged arrowheads									17													11									Flint 									Blanks for arrowheads									2													12									Flint									Plano-convex knife/striker									1													13									Flint									Knives									5													14									Flint									Scrapers									10													15									Flint									Other tools and utilised flint flakes									5													16									Flint									Flakes and blades - debitage from flint-working									33													17									Flint									Further flint pieces recovered from soil samples, not yet 			assessed in detail									73													18									Flint									Fragments of burnt flint									19													19									Bone									Boar=s tusks, all certainly or possibly trimmed to give 			functional ends or edges									4													20									Bone									Antler (or bone) rods - possible flint-working tools									2													21									Bone									Antler spatula - possible polishing and burnishing tool									1													22									Bone									Bone hammer-headed pin									1													23									Bone									Degraded bone or antler fragment									1													24									Shell									Perforated oyster shell									1										&nbsp;			&nbsp;						Total									213						Metal compositionThe metal composition of the two basket ornaments has not been tested, but after inspection the compiler of this report is confident that they are of high-purity gold.Identification&nbsp;The gold basket ornaments are of a known type belonging to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. The type had been recorded from Beaker graves on three previous occasions, two of the finds being from central southern England. In broad terms, these and other types of early gold trinket date between 2500 and 2000 BC.Although the extensive inventory of finds is quite exceptional for a single interment of the Beaker series, none of the finds individually is unexpected. All of the types can be accommodated within the earlier half of the Beaker grave sequence (total sequence circa 2500 - 1700 BC). Pending detailed study, the particular composition of the assemblage points to a date circa 2300 - 2150 BC.GRAVE 1236The quality of workmanship of the Companion&rsquo;s ornaments seems to be a little better than that of the Archer&rsquo;s.Metal compositionAgain, the metal composition has not been tested, but Dr Fitzpatrick of Wessex Archaeology is confident that the two ornaments are of gold.IdentificationAs in grave 1289, the ornaments are of the &gt;basket= type. The boar=s tusk and flint implements, although not especially diagnostic, are regular accompaniments at this period.",1,,"DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONThere is no doubt that the majority if not all of the finds in the graves were purposeful inclusions, placed in homage to powerful and respected individuals in Copper Age society. In grave 1289 only the flints within items 17 &amp; 18 might conceivably be accidental inclusions at the time of backfilling the grave; all other objects were observed to lie in careful arrangement around the corpse.The objects itemised above as 7-9 require special discussion, since unlike all the others they are not obviously humanly modified. The 1996 Treasure Act explicitly excludes &gt;unworked natural objects (such as fossils, minerals or human or animal remains)= (Code of Practice, clause 11). The fossils should thus be excluded from eligibility. However, a case can be made for including the iron pyrites nodules and fragments, since there is evidence for the recurrent inclusion in Beaker period graves of fire-kits, comprising a flint striker and an iron pyrites nodule. On this basis, the nodules are almost certainly cultural artefacts used for fire-making.Similarly, only the cultural artefacts in grave 1236 are eligible as Treasure: the gold ornaments, the fired clay, flintwork and any modified or utilised animal bones.Dr S.P.

One terminal is obscured by this coiling but would appear to be the same as the visible example. The sheet is pierced by two visible circular holes (c.1mm diameter) placed at the corners of visible terminal.The outer surface of the sheet has incised decoration consisting of 16 parallel lines that run the length of the object taking up its entire width. This creates a ridged design. The reverse is plain although traces of the upper design&rsquo;s creation are faintly visible.The object is a bright gold colour.Dimensions: In its current state the bracelet is 16.8mm long, 18mm wide, the sheet being c.16.9mm wide, 6.3mm thick in profile, the sheet being 0.7mm thick and weighs 3.90 grams including soil stuck within the coil.Discussion: &nbsp;Similar gold strips with incised decoration have been found as isolated objects in Hampshire (2019 T866 Hinds 2019, 2019T 513 Adams 2019), Shropshire (2017 T42 Oakden 2017), Yorkshire (2019 T274 Griffiths 2019), Sussex (2018T513 Richardson 2018) Staffordshire (2016 T1039 Gilmore 2016), and Warwickshire (2007 T672 Bolton 2007).One has also been found in a hoard on the database from Cornwall (2020 T222 Tyacke 2020) which has been dated to the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 cal BC following Roberts et al. 2013)Similar narrow embossed strips are also illustrated by Taylor (1980, fig 28a-f) which are suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age.Further multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) while an in-context example has been found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium&nbsp;BC.As such there are a number of parallels spread from across the country that would support this is Bronze age in date, these tend to be suggested to be Early Bronze Age but the Penard dated hoard cited above suggests they may also date later into the Bronze Age.Conclusion:&nbsp; The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-07-24T00:00:00Z,2022-07-24T00:00:00Z,"South East",Oxfordshire,"South Oxfordshire","Restricted access","Pyrton CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Oxfordshire Museums Service",1215025,images/edwardcaswelloxon/,2022T736.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,OXON,2022-08-03T09:34:08Z,2024-05-23T08:38:28Z

The straight inner face has also split away from the angled upper and lower faces in places. The gap in the penannular ring is 7.6mm wide. The terminals are plain. They were probably once flat, but have become distorted. The ring is now slightly oval. It is 30mm long, 28.4mm wide and 7.5mm thick. 6.7g.&nbsp;X-ray analysis undertaken by the finder&nbsp;indicates a gold content of 85.66%.Compare HAMP-259538 (2022 T138),&nbsp;LANCUM-968995 (2019 T464),&nbsp;SUR-EFB639 (2019 T87),&nbsp;SOM-50218D (Not Treasure) and&nbsp;SUSS-5EA230 (2017 T349).There are now a number of lock rings recorded on the database that have been classified as treasure including HAMP-259538 (2022 T138), LANCUM-968995 (2019 T464), SUR-EFB639 (2019 T87), SOM-50218D (Not Treasure) and SUSS-5EA230 (2017 T349).As with these examples the object can be termed a lock-ring, a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007; Armbuster 2021; 212-9). Of the examples recorded to date the majority are formed of gold sheet often shaped around an organic core (La Niece &amp; Cartwright 2009).&nbsp;They have been found primarily in contexts dating to the Late Bronze Age particularly the Ewart Park phase (950-800 cal BC following Roberts et al 2013) (Cowie et al 1991; Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Needham et al 2008, 43; Northover 1995, 525-9) although there are only a few radiocarbon dates available to confirm this (notably of a hoard recorded on the database NCL-9F9F92; 2005T120; Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43).The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93, Armbruster 2021, 216). This current example appears to be formed of conjoined (probably soldered or possibly heat fused) gold wire. This can be seen on three other lock-rings. The first was reported through the Treasure Act from Leamington, Warwickshire (LEIC-D9CD94 2021 T515); another was found in Eldesborough, Buckinghamshire (Varndell &amp; Watters 2009); and the other from the antiquarian collection of the Rev. William Greenwell now housed in the British Museum but originally collected from Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland (Eogan 1969: 111 Cat No. 37 / BM Accession Number WG:20). Similar gold wire work can also be seen in a Late Bronze Age gold ornament possibly from Rathfarnham, County Dublin, Ireland (Cahill 2009:102-4 - National Museum of Ireland: object reg. no. NMI W51) and in a composite gold wire ornament from La Rochepot, Burgundy, France noted as unusual, if not unique, in form and dated to the Atlantic Late Bronze Age (Armbruster 2021)Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68&ndash;9, Armbruster 2021, 212). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95&ndash;6; Lynch 1991, 239&ndash;41). What is generally agreed, is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, the find-spots for these lock-rings currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-west Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, northern England and southern Scotland; and thirdly, East Anglia and south-eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41).Of about 30 examples of lock-rings on the PAS database, a significant number of these were discovered in hoards with other contemporary objects, as pairs (or more), and/or close to associated objects. While undecorated examples and examples of decorated sheet gold faces are recorded, the conjoined rib formation / decoration seems to be the most common type.&nbsp;References:Armbruster B.R. 2021: Le Ors de l&rsquo;Europe Atlantique A la&rsquo;Age du Bronze / Gold from Atlantic Europe in the Bronze Age.

The descriptions of the objects are as follows:Palstave: Probably of the Acton Park ii/Taunton metalwork style dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1400&nbsp;BC&nbsp;- 1250&nbsp;BC).The blade is crescentic in plan with the tips of the cutting edge chipped off in antiquity. In profile the object is sub-oval with the widest point being before the stop ridge. There is a clear casting seam along both edges of the object. There are slight bulges on the side just after the stop ridge.The palstave has a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges, which are complete. The septum has a depth of 6.56mm on one side and 5.56mm on the opposing side. Corrosion material adheres to both sides of the septum just before the stop ridge. The butt of the object is complete with a straight edge. The object is a mid-green to light brown in colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.Overall dimensions: 188.06mm in length, 75.01mm in width, 38.17mm in thickness and 660g in weight. No exact parallel for this palstave are illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) however it contains several features which are all seen on Early/Primary palstaves defined by this study and Rowlands (1976) study of metalwork in the south of Britain including the lack of a loop, flanges which rise above the stop ridge (typically a south western trait but also seen on Early forms e.g. No.776), an expanded nick in the blades (Schmidt and Burgess 1981: 126) width just below the stop ridge and apparently plain decoration. Both studies highlight how dating the origin of these forms is complicated by their rare association in hoards but that their use continues until at least the end of the Taunton phase.Socketed axehead: A late Bronze Age socketed axehead dating to c. 1000-800&nbsp;BC. This example belongs to the Ewart Park metalworking phase and is of the &#39;Meldreth&#39; type. The socket mouth is circular sectioned and flares outwards slightly at its upper edge. Below the mouth is a transverse collar, immediately beneath which is a single, D-shaped side loop. The main body of the axe is broadly rectangular in plan, expanding outwards along its length to produce a widely-flared sub-crescentic blade. One of the tips of the blade and the cutting edge are now chipped. A casting seam can be seen around the loop and down the opposing side of the axehead. The object has a dark green patina and patches of corrosion across all faces. Overall dimensions: 107.68mm in length, 47.58mm in width, 27.25mm in thickness and 187.65g in weight. This axeheads&rsquo; most distinctive features are the clear facets in its body alongside the widely spaced double collar at an oval shape fluted collar which categorise this as a Meldreth form axehead a type named after examples found in the Meldreth Hoard, Cambridgeshire (Hawkes and Smith 1955: 13). Many similar examples are illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: nos. 1212- 1252) who date this form from the Wilburton to Ewart park phases of the Late Bronze Age (c.1120-800 cal BC following Roberts et al. 2013). Needham (1990: 43) whilst recognising the type choose to group Meldreth forms within his group D (faceted axeheads). Similar examples on the database are SF-19193A, LANCUM-F46D05, DOR-3F8141 and WILT-A49B7A.Razor: An incomplete Late Bronze Age tanged bifid razor dating to circa 900-700 BC. The tang and all edges are broken. From the base of the handle down the centre of the object on both faces are three, slightly raised ribs. Overall dimensions: 47.31mm in length, 39.10mm in width, 2.19mm in thickness and 10.42g in weight. For comparable examples see PAS records NMS-3FD035, SOM-D64647, LON-9DB207 and CORN-D746F1. These are all identical to example illustrated by Jockenh&ouml;vel (1980: tafel 10-11) which are categorised as Type Feltwell suggested to date to c. 1120-800 cal BC in the same study.Blade Fragment: A fragment of a copper alloy spear tip or blade fragment dated to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (c. 1000-800&nbsp;BC). The fragment is lentoid in section and sub-triangular in plan. The blade tapers from a worn break to the tip where the very tip of the blade has broken away. The cutting edges are chipped and worn. There is a central mid-rib apparent on both faces of the blade. The object has a dark green patina with corrosion material adhering to both faces. The object is too damaged to provide further parallels to known types of tools and weapons.Overall dimensions: 50.86mm in length, 22.95mm in width, 6.28mm in thickness and 17.77g in weight. Discussion: These objects have been recovered within an area of intense Bronze Age activity of a potentially ritual nature. Specifically, Treasure cases recovered within the neighbouring parish of Hordley include a middle Bronze Age assemblage of two palstaves (2020 T547), a late Bronze Age hoard of two gold lock rings encased in lead wrapping (2018 T769); a late Bronze Age gold bulla (2018 T343); and two late Bronze Age hoards of socketed axe heads and other associated material (2018 T341 and 2018 T342). This assemblage appears to span the Middle to Late Bronze Age, much like the cases noted above. However three of the objects (2-4) may all be confidently dated from the Wilburton to Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c1200-800 cal BC following Roberts et al 2013). The palstave meanwhile typically dates to the Middle Bronze Age although examples are known as &ldquo;out of time&rdquo; objects in later hoards (see multiple examples in Knight 2019) such that its inclusion is not anomalous.Thus it is possible that all together these objects relate a legacy of ongoing Bronze Age activity across this location. &nbsp;Conclusion: As a single find of more than two base metal objects of prehistoric date, this find potentially qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).References: Hawkes, C.F.C. and Smith, M.A. (1955) Inventaria Archaeologica - An Illustrated Card-Inventory of Important Associated Finds in Archaeology Founded by M.

Report by Dr Ed Caswell.Object A:&nbsp;A bent, spiral-twisted ribbon torc dating to the Middle Bronze Age.&nbsp;The object is made of a flat (rectangular cross section) narrow thin gold strip that has been bent out of its original shape. The sheet is mostly straight sided (6.6mm wide, 0.7mm thick) narrowing only close to its terminals which narrow to rounded points folded over 180 degrees to be flat against the plate. The plate appears to have been twisted into a spiral with an unclear number of turns. It would have been then turned into a circular hoop but has since been bent&nbsp;into an irregular flattened shape.&nbsp;The object is a lustrous gold colour with scratched surfaces and soil in some cracks.Dimensions: In its bent, folded state the bracelet is 78.1mm long, c.40.8mm wide and weighs 20.18g.&nbsp;Date: Middle Bronze Age c.1400-1150 cal BC.Discussion: Similar ribbon torcs are pictured by Taylor (1980: fig 42, 44), Eogan (1994: fig 23B, 25). Similar examples were also found in the Priddy hoard (2005T523, SOM-1C2C53). The British Museum also holds several similar examples (Accession numbers 1873,0602.1, 1838,0718.1 and 1857,0729.1). These are sometimes described as Welsh type ribbon torcs (e.g. Taylor 1980: fig 42) and have been found in groups of gold hoards as at Lower Largo, Fife, and Heyope, Powys.&nbsp;Gold ribbon torcs like these are found most frequently in both Ireland and Scotland and are rare in Southern England (Eogan 1983, fig. 25; 1994, 47-79). The damage and distortion to the torc is not unprecedented, even within Somerset: the bracelet from the Edington Burtle hoard, Somerset, has a straightened terminal and appears to have been modified from a larger piece (the relatively loose twists of the Edington piece are also similar to Durley) (cf. Smith 1959, GB44).Object B:&nbsp;The object is made of a flat (rectangular cross section) gold strip that has been bent out of its original shape. At one terminal it has a rectangular terminal which is slightly thin and ragged, possibly suggesting it had been cut. There is a circular hole placed in the middle on the plate just offset from this edge (c1.5mm diameter) that has been punched through the plate. At this point the plate is broadly straight sided 25.7mm wide with slightly thickened edges. After c.23.6mm the plate becomes bent&nbsp;and torn. While&nbsp;it is not clear exactly where, the plate starts to narrow in a slightly convex curve to 6.7mm wide. From this point a rectangular tab or hook projects that is 3.7mm and 1mm thick. This is folded over 180 degrees and ends in a rounded terminal.&nbsp;The object is a lustrous gold colour with scratched surfaces and soil in some cracks.Dimensions: In its crushed state the bracelet is 84.2mm long, 30.6m wide and weighs 17.39 g.&nbsp;Date: Middle Bronze Age c.1400-1150 cal BC.Discussion: The artefact is closely paralleled by two conjoined objects classified as rings (possibly ear ornaments), from Binstead, West Sussex (TAR: 1998-1999, p. 10-11, fig. 3a) Maesmelan, Powys (Green et al 1993) and also from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo (Savory 1980: fig 47, No.1-2). A similar object, classified as a bracelet, has been recorded from Northfleet, Kent (TAR: 2004 T326; PAS: KENT-AAA333) and another from Freshwater, Isle of Wight (2014 T15, IOW-0195D2).In discussing the Kent bracelet, Stuart Needham is quoted as stating that &ldquo;The prevailing opinion is that these are of Bronze Age date and, if so, they are likely to date to before the middle of the Bronze Age (circa 1500/1400&nbsp;BC), after which the copper content of the gold rises significantly. A mature Early Bronze Age or earliest Middle Bronze Age date is feasible and would tie in with a similar date for the Heyope ribbon torcs with similar terminals from a hoard in Powys.&#39;Object C:&nbsp;A coiled gold bracelet probably dating to the Middle Bronze Age.&nbsp;The object is made of a rectangular-sectioned narrow gold strip that has been bent out of its original shape. The sheet is mostly straight-sided (9.4mm wide, 1.7mm thick) narrowing only close to its terminals which are squared-off points (1.7mm wide 1.9mm thick),&nbsp;bent over 180 degrees but not folded flat to the plate. The object has been coiled into a spiral over 540 degrees.&nbsp;The object is a lustrous gold colour with scratched surfaces and soil in some cracks.Dimensions: In its coiled&nbsp;state the bracelet is 45.5mm long, c.32.4mm wide, 11.5mm thick and weighs 46.48g.Date: Middle Bronze Age, c.1400-1150 cal BCDiscussion: Similar examples on the database include WILT-1D8478 (2022 T286), BUC-C07E88 (2009T435) one of which is described as a gold ribbon torc, which this is potentially too small in size to be described as, and the second an unclear fragment of uncertain date.

Narrow-ribbon ornaments from the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc hoard, Brittany, have fewer and correspondingly broader ribs/grooves. They are finer on an earring from Saint-P&egrave;re-en-Retz (Loire-Atlantique) and finer still on some Irish Bronze Age ornaments. Among the latter are examples in two important associations, from Saintjohns, Co Kildare, and Derrinboy, Co Offaly. The Derrinboy pieces have enhanced ribs along the long edges not present on the Fontmell Magna fragment. Good parallels are harder to find in Britain, but there is a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, excavated from a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age. Three gold grooved strips from Scottish grave finds which served as pommel mounts for Early Bronze Age daggers are crafted differently and may be less relevant.ConclusionThis object is predominantly of precious metal, is almost certainly over 300 years old and potentially of archaeological interest both locally and for broader stylistic studies.Dr S.P.

Most finds were made within a zone  25 x 10 metres in extent with just a few further away, up to  40 m. The finds circumstances are fully dealt with in Gloucestershire County Council?s preliminary report (Barrett & Vallender 2005); in summary they can be broken down into six groups:	Thirty-five objects were initially found before any archaeological involvement (nos 1-35); the finds were between 1 and 50 cm deep. Finder marked the positions of twenty-one findspots with pegs ? these were later surveyed in by GCC archaeologists.	Fifteen relevant objects were among those recovered during archaeological excavation of a 10 x 3 m trench in December 2004 (nos 39, 41-42, 44-47, 50-55, 57-58). One gold fragment (no 52) was later found to belong to one of the initial discoveries (no 31).	Following the excavation, but before the associated survey, Finder recovered a further two objects (nos 37, 43); no positions were marked, but they were reported to come from the area of the main scatter.	The archaeologically monitored gridded metal-detector survey, covering a zone 70 x 30 m roughly centred on the excavated trench, recovered a mixed assemblage of finds including three relevant to the Bronze Age deposit (nos 40, 48-49). Find no 40, furthest away from the main concentration proves to join no 16; however, it is not known whether the latter is one of the plotted initial finds.	Three more objects were submitted to the Corinium Museum by metal detectorists on 22 February 2005. These were reported to have come from an area about  40 m to the south of the main concentration, adjacent to a ploughed out field boundary on a NE-SW axis (nos 36, 38, 56).	Finally, object no 59 was later submitted by Finder, said to have been found in the same area, but the location has not been reported.Descriptions[Objects are gold unless otherwise stated]	Bronze awl or punch. Complete stout double-ended tool, both ends tapering to rather bullet-like tips. The shank section is round close to the ends, but mainly square with body angles locally faceted.

Total weight of the gold is 261.3 g and of the bronze 139.7 g. Because most of the material is fragmentary, there is the possibility that some might be from the same object. Two joins have been recognised and taking into account also possibly belonging fragments, having similar features and dimensions, a minimum of 38 different gold objects and five bronze implements can be suggested.

Similar gauges of rod or bar can be used for finger rings and bracelets, or for bracelets and neck ornaments, and even terminal forms may not be unique to one ornament category. Identifications therefore rely on finding good parallels in more complete form.Flange-twisted torcs with classic ?trumpet? terminals (group 2) are certainly represented in the near Cirencester find. It is not impossible that other fragments belonged to neck ornaments. Some of the medium-thick rods (group 5, especially nos 47, 49-51) could perhaps have been neck-rings strung with beads; fragments of such seem to have been present in the now-lost Beerhackett hoard, Dorset (Anon 1850, fig. D) and the sheet-gold cover from Cirencester (no 58) may represent one of the biconical attachments illustrated there.The thickest round rods present at Cirencester, averaging 5 mm thick and including that with a flat barely expanded terminal (nos 27-30, 46, 48) are more likely to come from simple penannular bracelets such as are known in a number of hoards of the Middle Bronze Age. Unfortunately their short extant lengths and distortion associated with fragmentation does not allow any useful assessment of curvature.The plain rod fragments of finer dimensions, down to wire proportions, seem consistently to belong to coiled finger rings, but these break down into three types in detail (group 4). Simple coiled rings of rod or wire are known in bronze in a few Middle Bronze Age contexts, but are not readily paralleled in gold in secure contexts. Likewise, the doubled-strand form is unusual, but the Beerhackett hoard contained similar ornaments both in plain rod and twisted rod (Anon 1850, figs B & C). They are described as being armlets, but were generally too small in diameter; it is perhaps more likely that they were coiled to form finger rings, as now seen clearly at Cirencester. A single find from Llanwrthwl, Brecknockshire (Savory 1980, no 304, 195 fig. 47; Taylor 1980, pl. 34c), is again made of doubled-strand thin rod, but as a finger ring it only forms a single circuit with a gap (penannular). The Beerhackett hoard also thus presents a possible identity for some (but not all) of the twisted rod fragments in this hoard (group 3); their rod diameters are similar to the illustrated one from Beerhackett.The final object likely to be from a finger ring is that chopped in two (nos 31 & 52). Although in unfinished state, its full length is only about 68 mm, so it would form a penannular ring of around 25 mm diameter unless significantly stretched in the final stages of manufacture.At least one of the thin twisted rods (group 3 no 7) cannot have come from the doubled-strand type of ornament, nor from a finger ring. Although of delicate proportions, its intact terminal follows the ?trumpet? pattern normally encountered on torcs. If this was from a torc, it was extremely fine; the alternative is perhaps a bracelet or armlet in matching style and secured by linking the two recurved terminals together in a similar (but uncertain) fashion. Twisted rods or wires can also evidently be used in multiples to form ornaments; this has come to light with the fine bracelet in the Burton hoard, Wrexham, in which six twisted wires have been fused together and clamped with folded strips at either end (Treasure case 2004/T2 Wales)The main gold type remaining for discussion is the familiar penannular ring of the later Bronze Age. Although the function of these is much debated, they are very distinct in form from finger rings, not least in their small internal diameters. As many as ten examples are present in the near Cirencester assemblage, eight of them being complete. Other than in having a round or near-round section and simple flattened terminals, they are not uniform. Six are single plain rods of modest thickness sometimes tapering towards the ends (nos 23, 24, 25, 43, 44, 45), two are similar but of double rod (nos 21-22), one is a much thicker single rod fragment (no 26) and the last is from a delicate wire example (no 42).There are a number of factors which could link the deposit to gold-working. Most obvious is the high proportion of the objects which have been chopped, cut or torn into fragments. Normally this would be interpreted as evidence of preparation for recycling. Certainly, it would be advantageous to break up the larger ornaments in order to fit the metal pieces in a crucible. However, fragmentation is not confined to those and the fact that similar treatment was received by objects that could easily have gone into a crucible intact or crushed suggests that the process of fragmentation also had a symbolic role. Similarly, the crushing flat of a small flange-twisted torc fragment (no 32) would again be totally unnecessary simply for the purpose of melting it down.Notwithstanding this qualification of the background to fragmentation, there is other evidence relating to metalworking in the form of unfinished pieces: two single-rod penannular rings (nos 44, 45) and a bar probably destined for a finger ring (no 31/52). Other penannular rings, notably nos 23 and 25, may be essentially finished, but have not acquired any obvious use-wear and may therefore be newly manufactured at the time of deposition.The five bronze implements from the find could be of importance in this context. Three can be described variously as awls, punches or tracers, any of which could have performed some role in applying dot and line decoration to gold. However, a conundrum is presented by the fact that these forms of decoration are not a feature of gold of the phase represented. The unusually large tanged knife would, on the other hand, be a very suitable implement for cutting up many of the gold artefacts. The spearhead tip cannot obviously be functionally related, but spearheads do occasionally occur in ornament-dominated hoards of the Middle Bronze Age.Most closely datable in the near Cirencester find is the flange-twisted torc, a type seemingly in use only during the Penard phase, circa 1300 ? 1150 BC. Given the fragmentary nature of the torcs, the possibility must be born in mind that deposition was later, but associations for the other types all allow a Penard date. What is recorded from the Beerhackett hoard sits comfortably at this horizon, and coiled finger rings in bronze are if anything typical of slightly earlier, Taunton phase metalwork (14th century BC). All but one of the bronzes could be of Penard date but are not specific to this phase. The exception is no 1, which has a high lead content not found before the succeeding Wilburton phase. In fact, this object need not be Bronze Age at all; it is not a classic Bronze Age awl form and heavily leaded bronze compositions are also known in the Roman period. Fieldwork on the site yielded a number of Roman pottery finds.The dating of the varied penannular rings (group 6) does require some further elucidation. The type is conventionally dated to the Late Bronze Age, circa 1150 ? 800/750 BC, but occurs in only a few associations of that date. Those examples have base-metal cores covered in gold sheet and can be punch-decorated. Gold-covered and other more intricate varieties (especially striped ones) probably are of full Late Bronze Age date, but it is possible that the simple plain solid rod versions seen at Cirencester began earlier. Single, double and triple penannular rings with flat to hollow backs are associated with Penard phase hoards at Stretham, Cambridgeshire, and Boyton, Suffolk (Eogan 1994, 56-7 figs. 21 & 22), while the rings associated with a twisted torc from Haxey, Lincolnshire, include two quadruple-rod penannulars and a coiled rod all with oval rod sections (Taylor 1980, pl. 39c). The Blinkbonny, Northumberland, group of interlocked rings includes three triple-rod penannulars and a single coil of rod ? these are all round in section (ibid, pl. 34a)A final association of particular relevance is the assemblage of forty-two gold pieces from Fitzleroi Farm, West Sussex (British Museum accession 1996 9-2 1-42). Not only does this have two complete penannular rings of solid rod (one single, one double), it also shares with Cirencester a number of other features: flange-twisted hoop fragments, a plain-rod coiled finger ring, and a high frequency of chopped up segments of rod and bar; many round section rods of differing thicknesses, octagonal section bars and flat/ribbon fragments; terminals are consistently flat-ended and unexpanded. The Fitzleroi hoard also includes two complete (and therefore certain) plain penannular bracelets and a fragment of an ingot.ConclusionAlthough some very unusual elements are present in the near Cirencester find, there is no reason to doubt that originally it was either a single deposit or a series of related deposits made over a short period. It would appear that material of very similar character, and even two joining pieces, may have been spread over a fairly large area. Plough-dispersal is certainly plausible to account for this, particularly since all of the well-recorded pieces came from the modern ploughsoil. The date of deposition would have been within the Penard phase or shortly after, circa 1300 ? 1100 BC. Dr S.P.

No 2 is the more regular type and is widely distributed in Britain. Bracelet no 1 is much more unusual; its closest British parallel is a new find from Donhead St Mary, Hampshire, which is a reworked bracelet slightly thickened at the terminals rather than out-turned (Treasure case 2005T1). A group of three C-section bracelets in a hoard from Matignon in Brittany are similar (Elure 1982, 181 fig.169). The Tisbury hoard, Wiltshire, includes two bracelets again with broad C-section bands, but these have large tongue-shaped terminals very different from the vestigial ones at Gisburn (Eogan 1994, pl.11 nos 4&5). In addition to having an unusual form, bracelet no 1 has an unparalleled composition. Taking account of the specific gravity of the piece and the preferential loss of copper at the surface due to corrosion, the scientific work makes it clear that this object had either an extremely low gold content throughout, or a thickish coating of gold around a base-metal core. Neither of these compositions has been encountered in Bronze Age goldwork before.These two bracelets broadly conform to types known in the Late Bronze Age of Britain and north-west Europe, one (D-section) being more common than the other. Certain typological details and the composition of bracelet no 1, however, cannot as yet be matched among Bronze Age metalwork. Without cutting a section for full metallographic analysis, it is not possible to be more specific about its internal composition, but even the surface composition is highly unusual.Dr S.P.

There are two modern scrapes on the main loop.Composite rings have been found singly and associated with other gold personal ornaments. They may also be found linked together. In Britain they may be dated by association to the Middle Bronze Age, c.1300-1100BC.

Twisting is a regular feature of Middle Bronze Age gold bar ornaments in Britain and Ireland, and in general this may offer the best context. Although most commonly of square section, such ornaments can occasionally have a triangular section (Eogan 1994, 53-7). Also unusual is the intermittent nature of the twisting, but very occasional parallels can be found. It is possible that intermittent twisting may in some cases indicate that an ornament had not been finished. The hoard from Cappeen, Co Cork, is particularly relevant to the Risby-cum-Roxby fragment in containing these two unusual features, albeit on separate objects: a fully twisted neckring of triangular section and an intermittently twisted bracelet, or rod, of square-section (Eogan 1994, 63 fig. 27A).This can be accepted as a probable fragment from a Bronze Age ornament, although not necessarily from a finished piece.

At the wider end the terminal is broken, leaving an angled, irregular edge. The ribbon tapers gently to the opposing terminal, which is neat and straight, and therefore likely unbroken. The ribbon is decorated with eight parallel grooves, forming nine ridges, that extend from the wider, broken terminal to just over halfway along its length. There is also a transverse indentation approximately halfway along the ribbon which may or may not be intentional. Approximately 2.5 mm before the end of the ribbon there is a transverse groove and the remaining &lsquo;tip&rsquo; of the terminal is angled slightly. It can be assumed that the ribbon was once longer, and that the longitudinal grooved decoration continued along its main body. The gold sheet is very thin and so the grooved decoration is mirrored on the opposing surface.Dimensions:&nbsp;20.83 mm in length, 13.35 mm in width at the wider terminal, 8.81 mm wide at the narrow terminal, it is 0.55 mm thick and weighs 0.71 g.Similar grooved gold ribbons are known from throughout Britain, and are dated to the Bronze Age, for example, in the British Museum collection: 2004,0904.1.a-b; 1906,1224.1; and 2014,8014.1. Further examples of Bronze Age grooved ribbon can be found on the PAS database, including LVPL-BBA759, OXON-A33005, WILT-0990D5, and WMID-804501. There also comparable ribbons that taper towards the terminal as in this example, e.g., OXON-40190C, HAMP-0FCEE9, and PAS-35C8A8. Although it is unclear what the ribbons were used for, Eogan (1994) has&nbsp;categorised&nbsp;these objects as&nbsp;&lsquo;Tress&rsquo;-rings (e.g., BM 1839,0426.9), including them in his discussion of gold working in the mid to late Bronze Age. More generally, there are a range of comparable ribbon gold ornaments known from the duration of the Bronze Age. However, this object also finds parallels with the earlier Bronze Age sheet gold tradition and an excavated example found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit, along with a flint scraper and pottery consistent with the Beaker period (Palmer 1980, 131-132). Therefore, the date range given for this ribbon is c. 2350-800 BC.*The ribbon was originally submitted as part of a potential hoard along with a Bronze Age palstave (DEV-ACB261). However, gold ribbons of this from are notable for having few in context discoveries and so few direct associations with contemporary items. The gold ribbon has been described by the finder having been &ldquo;found one foot away but a little deeper&rdquo;. A test pit has also been reported by the finder as having been dug in the area by archaeologists. The results of this excavation suggests that both were &ldquo;found in hill wash and were out of context, most probably through ploughing&rdquo;. Therefore, while the ribbon and the palstave were&nbsp;found suitably close to suggest they may have come from a single deposit their location in a disturbed hill wash context requires there to be good evidence why this might be the case rather than the items being buried over two separate events in the same region. While ribbons have been given broad dates, their only firm association has been with objects dating to the Early phase of the Bronze Age. The axehead meanwhile is of a type suggested most frequently to be found in isolation (Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or alternatively with material dating to the Middle Bronze Age. As these are not contemporary periods the ribbon, being an object of more than 10% precious metal over 300 years old qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 while the palstave does not on the balance of probability meet this threshold.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-02-27T00:00:00Z,2022-03-11T00:00:00Z,,Devon,"East Devon","Restricted access","Dunkeswell CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Informed finder that the object should be submitted as Treasure",,1193867,images/rwebley2/,2022T421goldimage.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,DEV,2022-04-29T12:46:55Z,2025-04-07T15:10:14Z

They have variously been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Eogan 1994; 1997; Green 1988), but their function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange (see debate in Armbruster 2021: 191-196). The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.They are given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing Raftery 2004, 87-8) that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3d gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-04-23T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Surrey,Waverley,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Godalming Museum",1180535,images/smaslin/,SUR6C5354.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,SUR,2022-04-25T16:58:45Z,2025-03-01T07:05:38Z

Meanwhile a gold plate with raised ridges is also included in a cylindrical box found in an Early Bronze Age burial at little Cressingham (Barton 1849).An Early Bronze Age date would be supported by an in-context that has been found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC. A similarity of this to to Early Bronze Age Scottish dagger pommel strips (see Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f for images of these) has been noted (Case in Palmer 1980: Fiche A06) but dismissed as it is missing the flange that was present on the Scottish daggers. One further example on the database has also been found in a hoard from Cornwall (2020 T222 Tyacke&nbsp;2020) which has been dated to the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 cal BC following Roberts et al. 2013)As such there are a number of parallels spread from across the country that would support this is Bronze age in date, these tend to be suggested to be Early Bronze Age but the Penard dated hoard cited above suggests they may also date later into the Bronze Age.Based on similar objects this object dates before 1720 and as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South East",Hampshire,"Test Valley","Restricted access","Longstock CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1176269,images/pipsmither/,BERK86D781.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,BERK,2022-03-09T09:03:52Z,2023-03-22T13:54:02Z

It is hollow and triangular in cross-section, formed of two flat (angled) outer faces and an internal slightly concave face. The damage to one of the outer faces reveals a hollow interior and the faces formed of conjoined, narrow, circular-sectioned gold wires. There are sixteen of these wires on each outer face with an additional spinal wire at the outermost join and a wire forming the outer edges of the internal face along the opposite (inner) join. The internal face is formed of 14 wire (including its edge wires).On the undamaged face, the two or three wires closest to the outermost edge appear to have several groupings of diagonal incised lines.The lock-ring is C-shaped and the triangular terminals are undecorated with an uneven surface. The edge this forms on each face is equally uneven and may suggest the metal has been melted to form this surface.The object measures 23.4mm in length, 22.2mm in width, 5.7mm in max.thickness (0.6mm in min.thickness at the outermost edge) and weighs 4.53g.",1,,"The following discussion is taken partly from&nbsp;that first published in&nbsp;LVPL-5DFE32&nbsp;(2013 W06) and subsequently copied on other records.This can be identified as a lock-ring, a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt&nbsp;et al&nbsp;2005; Needham&nbsp;et al&nbsp;2007). The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000&ndash;800 B.C.) (Eogan 1969, 106&ndash;7, 130&ndash;46; Cowie&nbsp;et al&nbsp;1991; Northover 1995, 525&ndash;9; Needham&nbsp;et al&nbsp;2008, 43). Previous radiocarbon dating in 2007&ndash;8 of a hoard of Bronze Age artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, provided a date of 2771 +/- 26 BP, calibrating to 1000&ndash;840 B.E. at 2 sigma (Needham&nbsp;et al&nbsp;2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68&ndash;9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95&ndash;6; Lynch 1991, 239&ndash;41). What is generally agreed, is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, the find-spots for these lock-rings currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-west Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, northern England and southern Scotland; and thirdly, East Anglia and south-eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41).Of c.31 examples of lock-rings on the PAS database, a significant number of these were discovered in hoards with other contemporary objects, as pairs (or more), and/or close to associated objects. While undecorated examples and examples of decorated sheet gold faces are recorded, the conjoined rib formation/ decoration seems to be the most common type.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-01-30T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Hampshire,"Test Valley","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","The British Museum",1173895,images/khindshamp/,HAMP259538.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,HAMP,2022-02-08T11:51:47Z,2025-07-07T10:51:44Z

The fragment is broadly rectangular in cross section and measures 26.58mm in length. It has been loosely twisted, probably as part of decoration. The twist is regular which suggests this was part of the object when it was worn rather than occurring during later deposition. The fragment is &lsquo;hooked&rsquo; in shape overall and weighs 8.35g.

The object is similar in shape to the terminals on CAM-E5D871, suggesting that this could be a possible function.A further example includes DOR-C5C932 which includes the following discussion:These fragments belong to a Middle Bronze Age ornament, probably of the Penard phase. The fragment is similar to another example, from Gloucestershire (Treasure case 2007 T510).The discussion of that find relate equally well to this case: the penannular bracelet is of bar-twisted type characteristic dating to c. 1300-1100 BC known in Ireland and Britain. Eogan (1994, 50) classifies the form of bar bracelet as type iii. The bracelet fragment can be closely paralleled with two complete examples found at Saintjohns, Co. Kildare (Eogan, 1994, 63, fig 27B 2-3, plate XII, Taylor 1980, 9-10). Twisted gold bracelets and torcs have been found in fields in Wiltshire and throughout southwest England though they have tended to be deposited with accompanying gold objects (Roberts 2007).References:Eogan, G.1994.

Penannular rings with more than three strands are less frequently recorded on the PAS database although an 11-strand ring from Kent has been recorded as SUR-1B64F5 (2012 T659).&nbsp; A 6-strand ring can also be found on the British Museum&rsquo;s Collections online (WG.19), which is an Irish example with a broad date of c1300-750BC, from Arboe, County Tyrone.Meeks et. al. (2008, 13) &nbsp;notes that &ldquo;although small, penannular rings are amongst the most common items of gold to survive from the British Bronze Age, they remain one of the most problematic classes of prehistoric artefacts as they generally lack good contexts or associations with other classes of metalwork, making them difficult to date accurately&rdquo;. These objects also take several forms with those that are thicker than this example (such as OXON-FFD016, 2020T77) given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997).However this multiple-strand&nbsp;form made of relatively narrow cords has parallels found in at least three Bronze Age hoards. The first, the Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745 &ndash; Welsh Treasure case 04:02), includes a composite gold penannular ring formed from three round-sectioned wires which have been fused together, with simple clipped or cut terminals. The Cirencester Hoard (BM-28B710 &ndash; 2004 T416) includes two double penannular rings and a fragment of a third. Finally the Granta Fen hoard (British Museum Accession No. 1884,0520) includes several multi-stranded penannular rings looped around a gold bracelet which was found with an incomplete rapier. Each of these hoards have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c1300-1150&nbsp;BC)&nbsp;based on the range of chronologically diagnostic artefacts within them which would suggest this form may be dated to this period.Statement:&nbsp; In terms of age, and being made of more than 10% precious metal, this object would qualify as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.References:British Museum Collection available online at https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_WG-19 [accessed: 25/10/22]Eogan, G., 1997,&nbsp;&lsquo;Hair-rings&rsquo; and European Late Bronze Age society.

It is 28.4mm external diameter, 20.5mm internal diameter, 4mm thick and weighs 13.2g.The internal angle makes it unlikely that this ring was worn as a finger ring.

The lock-ring has been squashed flat and appears to lack a solid inner core which would have prevented the collapse or squashing. The lock-ring would have originally been triangular in section with central tubes and side plates formed from the same sheet and secured by a binding strip of round sectioned gold wire fused to the plate to form an outer rim-binding to the rim. The face plate is decorated with fine, narrow, concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates imitating fine wire works. The lock-ring would have originally been C-shaped, but has been bent out of this shape in antiquity. Dimensions:37.28mm in length, 12.56mm in width at its middle point,&nbsp;2.55mm in thickness, and weighs&nbsp;6.45g.Discussion: The following discussion is taken mostly from&nbsp;that first published in LVPL-5DFE32 (Treasure Case 12.16 Wales and 2013.06 Wales) by Adam Gwilt and subsequently copied on other records.This can be identified as a lock-ring, a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007). The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronzed Age (1000&ndash;800 B.C.) (Eogan 1969, 106&ndash;7, 130&ndash;46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525&ndash;9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Previous radiocarbon dating in 2007&ndash;8 of a hoard of Bronze Age artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, provided a date of 2771 +/- 26 BP, calibrating to 1000&ndash;840 B.E. at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68&ndash;9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95&ndash;6; Lynch 1991, 239&ndash;41). What is generally agreed, is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Britain, the find-spots for these lock-rings currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-west Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, northern England and southern Scotland; and thirdly, East Anglia and south-eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of similar Late Bronze Age gold penannular lock-rings have been discovered and recorded on the PAS database as Treasure both within hoards of objects (e.g. NCL-9F9FF92 / 2005 T120; SF-BDA986 / 2011 T478; LVPL-5DFE32 / Treasure Cases 12.16 Wales and 2013 W06; SUSS-C65251 / 2012 T832; GLO-E9EC16 / 2013 T805; NMS-6DAFAC / 2016 T470; LANCUM-C98FBF / 2017 T352; HESH-9EC8BE / 2018 T769) and as singular finds (BH-8DC056 / 2009 T513; NMGW-218BE3 / 2009 W4; ESS-C0C162 / 2014 T193; BERK-4A433E / 2016 T106; ESS-5ECCA2 / 2016 T592; SUSS-5EA230 / 2017 T349; LANCUM-C2543F / 2017 T810; SUR-EFB639 / 2019 T87; NCL-066786 / 2019 T94; LANCUM-968995 / 2019 T464; ESS-EDCA69 / 2019 T1068; LEIC-D9CD94).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the sixth such gold lock-ring to be recorded on the PAS database from Cumbria. Possibly of significance, and worth noting here, is the relatively close proximity of the discovery of this find to the find spot of the recorded Bronze Age hoard LANCUM-C98FBF (2017 T352). This ring was discovered 688 metres south-west of the previously recorded hoard. This singular lock-ring is similar in form and style to the three lock-rings recorded in the hoard, and may have been intended for deposition as part of this hoard, or possibly made by the same craftsman or workshop. Conclusion: The item comprises more than 10% precious metal content and is dated at over 300 years old at time of finding. Additionally, it is of prehistoric date and contains a proportion of precious metal. On both counts it therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 and Designation Order 2002.

One, folded roughly into four, would have been approximately 70.0mm in length&nbsp;originally, with parallel edges tapering down to a point at each end, therefore a long flat trapezium shape, possibly cut from a larger sheet. Threaded through the loop created by one of the folds in this item is a strip of gold which is thicker than the first item but much narrower, almost thread-like. The cut ends, which are a little narrower than the rest, have been twisted together to hold the strip to the larger item.Dimensions:Overall folded length of the two items: 31.7mm. Overall weight: 4.51g.Item 1 - Folded length: 21.2mm; Unfolded length c.70mm in length; Width: 7.4mm; Thickness: 0.62mm.Item 2 - Folded length: 12.2mm: Unfolded length: c.35mm; Width: 2.3mm; Thickness: 0.8mm. Discussion: Without further diagnostics, it is difficult to confirm the dating or use for this find. It may represent pieces of gold strip wrapped together as metal working debris, or to make up a bullion bundle, perhaps for exchange purposes. Two similar artefacts recorded onto the PAS database are BUC-C07E88 (2009T435), a Middle Bronze Age hooked-terminal ribbon torc, and SOM-1C2C53 (2005T523), a Middle Bronze Age hoard including several hooked-terminal torcs. The find seems to be too short to be such a torc and weighs far less than these examples. A closer resemblance can be made, however, to record SUR-0B591E (2019T587), a piece of Roman bullion. The database example consists of three pieces of inter-twisted gold, where this item is only two, but comprises two flatter, wider strips coiled inside a thicker, narrower strip. The possibility therefore also exists that this gold might be Roman bullion, weighing close to 4 scripulae (1.14g), the scripula being 1/24th&nbsp;of an ounce.There are other Bronze Age and Roman finds within the area.Conclusion: Despite the lack of diagnostics for this item, it is over 300 years old and comprised of over 10% precious metal and qualifies as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.Alix SmithFinds Liaison Assistant for WiltshireSophie HawkeFinds Liaison Officer for WiltshireReferences: Maslin, S., 2019, SUR-0B591E Unidentified Object.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 11.9 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 21.1 mm (thickness 2.5 mm).It measures 46.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 21.1 mm, width at the butt is 11.9 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 23.5 grams.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.

Due to the condition and the small size of the fragment the overall design is unclear. The sheet has been folded into two and it is difficult to establish if this is deliberate and post depositional or later damage in the ploughsoil. What remains of the decorative design consists of a series of nine circular pointille bosses formed with a round headed punch or awl that has been worked from the underside to create the form. These bosses are arranged along one long edge from which springs a diagonal band that runs across the centre. On the opposing edge is one incomplete boss that has been damaged at the outer edge. The damage to the short sides seems to be torn rather than cut and it is likely that this occurred prior to deposition. The metal of the foil is a mid-yellow coloured gold with slight surfacing scratching commensurate with movement within the plough zone. Dimensions: The foil measures 7.4&nbsp;mm in length, 5.2&nbsp;mm in width, 2.1 mm in thickness as the object is folded over and the sheet measures 0.7 mm in thickness and weighs 0.34 grams.Discussion:&nbsp; The shape style and form of this gold foil artefact is similar to other examples reported as potential treasure and recorded on the PAS database. Close comparable examples include a gold ribbon ornament from Salle, Norfolk (Marsden 2019) which in form is a longer strip with two longitudinal rows of similar punched dots, some set in pairs&nbsp;and&nbsp;others offset to give a zig-zag effect. This example has been dated to the Early to Middle Bronze Age period. Another parallel can be seen from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Byard 2016); this example is a folded gold decorated strip. Its function is unknown however it is most probably an item of personal adornment; it is paralleled against the Bideford example above due to a similar repousse punched decorative motif. A final parallel can be seen from Stratford Upon Avon, Warwickshire (Bolton: 2016); this example is described as a possible diadem or neck choker/band, perhaps fixed to a leather item. The edges of this example have a border of fine rounded pointille decoration, spaced at irregular intervals, similar to that seen on the example above. The overall form of these gold sheets is known, however their function is poorly understood. It is thought that they act as decorative mounts applied to other objects of personal dress which include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck chokers and decorative strips attached to leather.Treasure Statement The foil has not been tested for its metal content, however based on the comparison to other examples noted above, it likely meets the minimum treasure threshold of 10% precious metal, in this case gold. Although the age of the object is uncertain based on the design elements and comparisons to other gold foil decorated with repousse decoration, it is on the balance of probabilities most likely to be of Bronze Age date (2150-1150 BC) and therefore more than 300 years old when found.

The exterior longitudinal edges are slightly thicker than the internal ridges, creating a border to the band. Both terminals appear to have been cut leaving a straight edge.

Many years ago I would have doubted the veracity of the findspot, or suspected a collector&#39;s loss, However, there are now sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard, Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have to be Early Bronze Age.

Thickness of sheet:&nbsp;0.3-0.6&nbsp;mm.&nbsp;Weight:&nbsp;1.8g.Discussion: Lines of punched dots (sometimes described&nbsp;as&nbsp;pointill&eacute;&nbsp;decoration) are found on several Bronze Age ribbon&nbsp;ornaments, such as&nbsp;BUC-4313C7, DOR-015978,&nbsp;BERK-BA8440,&nbsp;WAW-FF1E9A and&nbsp;PAS-35C8A8. longitudinal creases and thickened edges are found on WILT-34D958. Several of these parallels have tapered ends, but generally the dots are simple single lines and the kind of elaborate decoration seen here is unusual.Date: Despite the relatively complex decoration, the object&nbsp;fits well into this&nbsp;group of ribbon or strip ornaments of early to middle Bronze Age date, c. 2350 to 1000&nbsp;BC.",1,,"As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.HER Event number&nbsp;ENF152002",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-06T00:00:00Z,2021-11-06T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,Broadland,"Restricted access","near Reepham",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1159571,images/norfolkarcher1/,BAStripOrnament.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2021-11-07T18:36:23Z,2023-12-04T16:38:56Z

All are Late Bronze Age and typically thought to be Ewart Park in Date.&nbsp;There are three Bronze Age hoards containing socketed axeheads from Lincolnshire recorded on the PAS database and declared as treasure, including Stixwould and Woodhall (LIN-CEDC78, &nbsp;2006T308) Near Horncastle (NLM-C95662, 2020T749) and Legsby (LIN-4783D6; &nbsp;2014T588). Of the Bronze Age hoards recorded on the PAS database from Lincolnshire, this hoard from near Grantham contains the highest quantity of socketed axeheads.

Similar multi-grooved strips of a Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48). A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database as 2010T664 (LVPL-83FE92). There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England. Other Bronze Age gold strips found singly such as at Flixton, Yorkshire (British Museum 2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16, no. 2) are broader and have more and narrower incised grooves. The annular ring from the Late Bronze Age hoard at Abia de la Obispalia, central Spain is comparable in form and dimensions but the grooves appear to have been incised rather than embossed (Almagro Gorbea 1974). Similarly, the Bronze Age annular ring from Armissan, southeast France may be comparable (Elu&egrave;re 1981, 48-49, fig. 55).Incised longitudinal grooves are present on at least one side of many of these examples. Some are plain strips whilst others exhibit one or two perforations. Other dates recorded within the Treasure cases suggest circa 2200-800, encompassing the entirety of the Bronze Age, whilst 2014T777 suggests a Middle to Late Bronze Age date of between circa 1600-800&nbsp;BC. In all of these examples, it is not clear what their function was. Conclusion: As the ribbon/bracelet is older than 300 years and has a precious metal content well in excess of 10%, it should be considered to be Treasure under the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.",1,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-04-11T00:00:00Z,2021-04-11T00:00:00Z,"West Midlands",Staffordshire,Stafford,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,1166863,images/tgilmore/,wmid804501_2021T768.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,WMID,2021-10-14T11:20:00Z,2024-10-09T13:21:44Z

At the base of the spade is a stem that tapers (to a diameter of 2.2mm) and rotates (relative to the remainder of the collar) before broadening to a maximum width of 10.5mm at the break. Both the upper and lower tips of the break are bent, giving the impression of an &lsquo;S&rsquo; shape. The sole decoration on the terminal is a thin lateral groove just above this break, with a series of ten punched dots in three groups, and one singular dot. Dimensions: 62.57mm long; 28.17mm wide; 1.05mm thick; 7.27g weight. Discussion:&nbsp;Lunulae are described as crescent-shaped flat plates with a sub-rectangular expansion at each end constituting the terminals, the latter being usually turned at right angles to the plane of the body and thus enabling the collar to be fastened (Eogan 1994, p30). The excellent condition of many recovered examples indicates they were cherished and cared for objects, possibly worn to symbolise power or rank and perhaps used in religious practices (ibid, 34). It is suggested that since few are found in association with graves lunulae may have been owned collectively by groups or clans rather than being personal property, while the style and form of decoration is indicative of close links to the Beaker period in the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age, c.2400-2000BC (Taylor 1980, p28; Eogan 1994, p33). Wiseman and Roberts, (2014, p359) characterise the period &nbsp;as the &ldquo;chalcolithic / early Bronze Age (c. 2500-1500 Bc) phase of gold-working in England and Wales&rdquo; where sheet metal-working techniques were used to produce a range of objects. Lunulae were themselves manufactured by the beating out of an ingot or rod, demonstrating considerable skill, with the thickness of the resulting sheet, applied decoration, and geographical distribution determining the tripartite classification of the lunula as defined by Taylor (1980, p25; Eogan 1994, p30). Classical and Unaccomplished lunulae are the most numerous, and are finely (often symmetrically) decorated with the sheets of gold beaten out very thinly. The majority have been found in Ireland, with only a handful of Classical examples being recovered in Cornwall; no Unaccomplished lunulae have been found outside of Ireland (Eogan 1994, p30-1). Provincial lunulae, as the name suggests, &ldquo;form a cohesive group by their geographical isolation from the other two&rdquo; being found (with isolated exceptions) solely outside of Ireland (Taylor 1980, p33 and 40). More specifically, Provincial forms are also thicker, thus more rigid, and more sparely decorated. Taylor (ibid) classifies two decorative variations: the dot-line, and the linear. The thickness and limited &lsquo;dot-line&rsquo; decoration on the lunula terminal described above (DUR-44A99A / 2021T748) indicate it is of the Provincial form. Only three other examples of lunulae have been recorded on the PAS database, all of the Provincial type: LANCUM-449151 / 2008T136 (Brampton, Cumbria); DUR-A24C08 / 2012T811 (Thwing, East Riding of Yorkshire); DOR-2198F8 / 2014T257 (North Dorset). While latter two each lacked only a single terminal in terms of completeness, the Cumbrian example (similar to DUR-44A99A / 2021T748 above) comprised only a single terminal. Elsewhere in mainland Britain only ten other lunulae have been recovered, making this example from Lincolnshire only the fourteenth such find. The terminal on this lunula is similar to the Cumbrian example (LANCUM-449151 / 2008T136); the record for the latter notes the similarity of the form of the terminal and punched linear geometric decoration to two Scottish Provincial examples recovered from Auchentaggart and Orbliston and illustrated by Taylor (1980, Pl. 17; see also NMS X.FE 2 and X.FE 3). Prior to the discovery of the East Riding lunula (DUR-A24C08 / 2012T811), Eogan (1994, p37) noted that the &ldquo;distribution in Britain is restricted to west Cornwall, north-west Wales and south-west Scotland&rdquo;. The latter example, and the one under discussion here (DUR-44A99A / 2021T748) show that this distribution is expanding as more lunulae are discovered and recorded, and often moving away from the usual coastal and upland areas as previously thought. Conclusion: The age and precious metal content of this object meets the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.

Their appearance in Britain most likely coincides with the beginning of the &#39;Ornament Horizon&#39; (c. 1400-1100&nbsp;BC), a new tradition of gold ornaments which coincides with the early Taunton to the later Penard metalwork phases for England and Wales (Roberts 2007: 7). This ring, therefore, can be generally dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400-1140&nbsp;BC).The object contains more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Reference:&nbsp;Meeks, Nigel D., Craddock, Paul T., &amp; Needham, Stuart P., 2008. &quot;Bronze Age Penannular Gold Rings from the British Isles: Technology and Composition&quot;.

It also is creased and torn in several locations, all presumably in antiquity. It is difficult to establish the original form of the object owing to its current condition. For example while there appears to be a rounded projection similar to that seen on the end of band this projects from a relatively wide flat plate quite unlike that seen on Early Bronze Age ribbons.Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of a folded metal sheet from Woodnesborough, Kent, indicated a surface composition of approximately 97-99% gold, 1-3% silver, the rest being copper.&nbsp;The folded metal sheet weighs 23.03 grams.Dimensions: In its folded state the object is 42.2mm long, 19.8mm wide, 11.8mm thick and weighs 23.03 grams.Discussion:&nbsp;The object has few diagnostic features barring a potentially rounded projecting terminal projecting from the fold. It is not uncommon for Bronze Age items to be found in a folded and twisted condition such as&nbsp;GLO-8372F2, DEV-FF9677, OXON-A33005 (Early Bronze Age gold ridged ribbons), YORYM-B1A82B, SUSS-096CEB (Early Bronze Age impressed ribbons , note the projecting tab on the latter) &nbsp;SUR-4956AF, BERK-73615E (an Early Bronze Age plain ribbon) and later items such as BERK-8F4E07. whilst the latter is thought to be part of a Middle Bronze Age torc the remaining examples are all suggested to be be Early Bronze Age in date. Further supporting this date is the high purity of the gold which is more common from the earlier phase of the Bronze Age (Taylor 1980: 21). As such whilst other periods cannot be excluded on the balance of probability this ribbon may be Bronze Age in date and so is likely to be over 300 years old.Treasure Conclusion: It is therefore clear that this object likely dates to before 1721 and, as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,,"Authors: Dr Edward Caswell, Finds Liaison Officer, Oxfordshire.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-06-18T00:00:00Z,2021-06-18T00:00:00Z,"South East",Kent,Dover,"Restricted access",Woodnesborough,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1320058,images/whitmj01/,KENT-490598_67c1a7059a637.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,KENT,2021-09-17T13:55:53Z,2025-07-04T15:52:03Z

One of these is a 'clean' cut so that the profile of the cross-section of the sheet is clearly visible, while the other is squashed and jagged. On one side of the sheet, a single deep score has been inflicted onto the gold. This runs down the centre, from one end to the other, suggesting this was done prior to the cutting. The other side is heavily abraded with linear markings that all run in one direction. This appears to have been done with a small tool which has been struck onto the surface and then dragged multiple times. This appears to have done after the fragment was cut. The object has then been bent midway along its length.Measurements: Length: 27.4mm; width: 10mm; thickness: 1.1mm; weight: 3.82gDiscussion: Gold sheet or 'ribbons' are a Bronze Age phenomenon which are usally found as incomplete objects. These ribbons are usually decorated with longitudinal grooves and where the terminals remain, these are sometimes perforated. It is possible that this fragment is that of a ribbon or pendant such as DOR-173265. The apparent deliberate damage which has been inflicted onto this object is consistent with other Bronze Age gold objects.

However Ingots of similar form have been discovered dating to the Bronze Age and Iron Age (e.g. SUR-3DE17A, CORN-4A3B9D and NMS-84B4AC). Undated linear ditches and an enclosure have been noted on the HER in the same vicinity.

Similar bar fragments have been found in Later Bronze Age gold hoards as at Fitzleroi Farm, Fittleworth (British museum Accesion No. 1996,0902.26) and Cirencester (2004 T416). Finally this form was not used in the Roman period and the weight does not relate to a Roman ounce (27.4g) or to a standard Viking weight (28g).

One end appears to have been flattened over again to conceal the copper alloy. The surface of the ring is decorated with a series of alternating parallel bands of two different alloys of gold or silver.Length 16.21 mm, width 9.03 mm, thickness: 5.92 mm and weight 3.01 g.Discussion: Similar objects have been recorded on the PAS database, dating to the Late Bronze Age, and classed as Treasure, such as DUR-1B2FA1 (2019 T1012), SF-45670E (2019 T110) and WILT-63B6DE (2020 T255). These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC). They have been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008), but their function remains uncertain (see discussion in Armbruster 2021: 191-196). It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating. However, burials in Belgium, north-east France, and The Netherlands, in addition to Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 BC (Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, evidence for earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, this penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC). Similar undecorated penannular rings on the PAS database include: SUR-C145ED, BM-275770, HAMP-2419C2 and LANCUM-C2543F.A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3d gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex.Conclusion: The object contains precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.References:Armbruster, B.R. 2021.

Originally the ring would have been C shaped in plan and bi-conical in form with the two opposing edges abutting forming a slight gap within the ring. It is formed of 25 or 26 individual square sectioned wires; all but two of these are twisted with an even clockwise turn creating a sinuous spiral like thread. Positioned on the upper and lower faces nearest the central hole are two plain wires acting as a border. The two terminals of the ring show evidence of direct heating that has melted the gold to form a single surface. There is little evidence of gold solder being used to hold the wires in place or to fill / flood the abutted terminals. Originally the C shaped ring would have been constructed around a similarly shaped organic core most probably created from Beeswax or wood &ndash; this element has been entirely lost. The centre is now partially filled with grey coloured soil &ndash; most probably from the burial environment. The ring has been heavily distorted from its original shape. It is impossible to tell if this damage has occurred solely through movement within the ploughsoil. It is now an irregular shape of distorted elements; the ring has been opened and is now broadly two C shaped crescents conjoined along a single opposing edge. This movement has caused several the wires to snap especially those positioned at the centre of the ring. Many of the turned wires on the exterior edge have only distorted &ndash; which has kept the broad integrity of the object.Length: 24.92 mmWidth: 12.81 mmThickness: 3.24 mmWeight: 2.31 gDiscussion and Dating: The form and nature of these bi-conical penannular rings known as &lsquo;lock-rings&rsquo; is well documented (Eogan 1969 &amp; 1994, Taylor 1984) in the archaeological record of the Late Bronze Age. This period is traditionally dated to c.1250-750 BC. The function of these rings is currently unknown; however, it is thought that the rings are best associated with personal dress and decoration possibly as hair or body (ear / nose / lip) ornaments. Of the examples recorded to date the majority are formed of gold sheet often shaped around an organic core (La Niece &amp; Cartwright 2009). Many examples are formed of plain sheet, whilst others are decorated with incised circumferential grooves or panels of applied repousse or incised linear decoration. This current example from Warwickshire is formed of conjoined (probably soldered or possibly heat fused) gold wires. The overall form of design echoes many other decorated examples with circumferential grooves for example a recently discovered ring from Wissendine, Rutland (Varndell &amp; Paites 2016). However, this style of wire goldworking decoration is relatively rare, it can be seen on two other lock-rings the first reported through the treasure act from Eldesborough, Buckinghamshire (Varndell &amp; Watters 2009) and the other from the antiquarian collection of the Rev. William Greenwell now housed in the British Museum but originally collected from Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland (Eogan 1969: 111 Cat No. 37 / BM Accession Number WG:20). Similar gold wire work can also be seen in a Late Bronze Age gold ornament possibly from Rathfarnham, County Dublin, Ireland (Cahill 2009:102-4 - National Museum of Ireland: object reg. no. NMI W51) and in a composite gold wire ornament from La Rochepot, Burgundy, France noted as unusual, if not unique, in form and dated to the Atlantic Late Bronze Age (Armbruster 2021)Metal Composition:The metal has not been tested but from appearance and complexity of form it is entirely consistent with the gold alloy used within the suggested period of construction (Bronze Age)&nbsp;Treasure Statement:As the precious metal content has not been formerly tested for this artefact it should be considered as Treasure under the 2002 Treasure (Designation) Order to the Treasure Act 1996 (DCMS: 2002) which states that an object, other than a coin, of prehistoric date is treasure if any part of it is precious metal (paragraph 6 &amp; 11).

Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003 opinion cited, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange'.They are given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing Raftery 2004, 87-8) that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC). Many penannular rings are composite with copper alloy cores but there is no evidence visually that that this is the case with this example. It is quite light which may indicate that it is composite.Eogan, G. 1997. ?Hair-rings? and European Late Bronze Age society. Antiquity, 71(272), 308-320.Green, H. S., 1988.

A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database as 2010T664 (LVPL-83FE92). There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England. Other Bronze Age gold strips found singly such as at Flixton, Yorkshire (British Museum 2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16, no. 2) are broader and have more and narrower incised grooves. The annular ring from the Late Bronze Age hoard at Abia de la Obispalia, central Spain is comparable in form and dimensions but the grooves appear to have been incised rather than embossed (Almagro Gorbea 1974). Similarly, the Bronze Age annular ring from Armissan, southeast France may be comparable (Elu&egrave;re 1981, 48-49, fig. 55).Incised longitudinal grooves are present on at least one side of many of these examples. Some are plain strips whilst others exhibit one or two perforations. Other dates recorded within the Treasure cases suggest circa 2200-800, encompassing the entirety of the Bronze Age, whilst 2014T777 suggests a Middle to Late Bronze Age date of between circa 1600-800&nbsp;BC. In all of these examples, it is not clear what their function was.Conclusion: As the ribbon/bracelet is older than 300 years and has a precious metal content well in excess of 10%, it should be considered to be Treasure under the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.",,,"N.B.

The butt is narrow, thin and rounded (with a width of 9mm and a thickness of 3.9mm). The sides are straight and gradually divergent to the two trunnions. The chisel is thickest at the position of the trunnions (63mm  - 78mm from the butt, where it has a maximum thickness of 10.3mm). The trunnions are now of rounded form (giving a maximum width to the tool of 33.1mm, protruding by 2-4mm and are 15mm wide). The sides of the blade are also straight and divergent towards the blade edge, now eroded (with a surviving width of 21.5mm). The blade edge has been lost and the edge is damaged, longer on one side. One face of the tool is more convex across its length than the other and both faces are flat across their widths, becoming gently convex along the blade. The surface of the tool has largely been lost, with a pale, bright-green corrosion underlying a grey-brown corroded surface. There is one surviving patch of dark brown patina surviving on one face near the position of the trunnions. Trunnion tools are a long-lived form of chisel spanning from the Arreton tradition at the end of the Early Bronze Age (1700-1500BC) to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800BC) (Brailsford 1953, 34, Fig. 12[1]; Burgess & Cowen 1972, 169-74[2]). A number of trunnion tools have been recovered from along the northern Marches and in north-east Wales. Examples have been found in the Broxton (Cheshire), Ebnal (Shropshire) and the Meol Brace (Shropshire) hoards. The former was associated with two Group III low-flanged palstaves and a basal-looped spearhead dated to the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1275BC) (Davey & Forster 1975 Cat. 66[3],; Longley 1987, 96-103[4]).  The latter, associated with two transitional palstaves of the Penard phase. A rich hoard from Burton, Wrexham contained two palstaves of Transitional type along with a number of gold ornaments dating to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. (Gwilt, Lodwick & Davis 2004)[5]. Single finds of trunnion tools have also been made at Talerddig (Powys), Llandudno (Conwy) (Hemp 1925)[6] and Llangynog (Carmarthenshire)[7]. While some trunnion tools can date from the end of the early Bronze Age, most associated examples are recovered from hoards dated to the Middle Bronze Age.[1]Brailsford, J.W.; 1953, Later Prehistoric Antiquities of The British Isles, London: British Museum.[2] Burgess, C. & Cowen, J.D.; 1972, The Ebnal Hoard and Early Bronze Age Metal-working Traditions, In F.

The tang (48mm long) is narrowest and thinnest at the butt (10.6mm wide and 0.9mm thick) which has a slight indent at the centre. Below the butt is a sub-circular perforation (4.0mm ? 4.3mm diameter positioned 5.3mm below the butt). The sides of the tang are straight and gently divergent towards the top of the blade (reaching a width and thickness of 14.9mm and 2.8mm respectively). Both tang faces are convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular section. The knife widens to the blade at the shoulders, where the knife has a maximum width (of 18.8mm), below which it narrows (for 20mm) before the blade edges appear to have been near-parallel sided (with a minimum width at the break of 8.9mm and a thickness of 1.5mm). The blade has a mid-ridge at the break, producing a lozengic section. Towards the top of the blade, the mid-ridge bifurcates to form a triangular panel, corresponding with the widening of the blade edge to the shoulders. The blade edge is damaged but blade facets are partially preserved on both sides. There is no clear evidence for blade damage that is contemporary with the use of the blade. The blade and tang now have a gentle bend across their length. The surface has numerous linear striations beneath the patina, running across both tang faces (at an angle of 20 ? 40 to the vertical axis of the tang) resulting from coarse finishing. The blade have coarse, irregular striations running along the top of the blade and the suggestion of finer striations running off the blade edges. There is a possible punched mark at the top of the mid-ridge and a corresponding dent at the same position on the opposite face, suggesting that the blade was punched while resting on edge. The surface has a dark-green to black patina with a white deposit on the tang, concentrated around the perforation.   Tanged and riveted knives are recovered in a variety of forms from the Middle Bronze Age onwards, though western British examples are not common. Studies (Pearce (1983), Knight et al. (2015) and Rowlands (1976, Pl.35)) illustrates two shouldered tanged knives with single rivet holes from Southern Britain, one from the River Thames, Berkshire, and another from Horningsea, Cambridgeshire. Rowlands considers tanged and riveted knives as belonging to the later Middle Bronze Age (Penard phase c.1275-1150BC). Comparable examples have been closely linked with Late Bronze Age material. Examples are present in the Grays Thurrock hoard, Essex (Turner 2010, No.02/134), and the Reach Fen hoard, Cambridgeshire (Smith 1956, GB.17 3(3) No.43), both of which are part of the Carp's Tongue complex in the Ewart Park phase (1000-800BC).

Penannular rings with more than three strands are less frequently recorded on the PAS database, although an 11-strand ring from Kent has been recorded as SUR-1B64F5 (2012T659).&nbsp; A six-strand ring can also be found on the British Museum&rsquo;s Collections online (WG.19), which is an Irish example with a broad date of c1300-750BC, from Arboe, County Tyrone.Meeks et. al. (2008, 13)&nbsp; notes that &ldquo;although small, penannular rings are amongst the most common items of gold to survive from the British Bronze Age, they remain one of the most problematic classes of prehistoric artefacts as they generally lack good contexts or associations with other classes of metalwork, making them difficult to date accurately&rdquo;.These objects also take several forms, with thicker, single-strand examples&nbsp;(such as OXON-FFD016, 2020T77) given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800&nbsp;BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands&nbsp;and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997).However, this composite&nbsp;form, made of relatively narrow strands, has parallels found in at least three Middle Bronze Age contexts. The first, the Burton Hoard (PAS-5B1745 &ndash; Welsh Treasure case 04:02), includes a composite gold penannular ring formed from three round-sectioned wires which have been fused together, with simple clipped or cut terminals. The Cirencester Hoard (BM-28B710, 2004T416) includes two double penannular rings and a fragment of a third. Finally, the Granta Fen hoard (British Museum accession no. 1884,0520) includes several multi-stranded penannular rings looped around a gold bracelet which was found with an incomplete rapier. Each of these hoards have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c1300-1150 BC) based on the range of chronologically diagnostic artefacts within them, which would suggest this form may be dated to this period.Date: Middle Bronze Age,&nbsp;c. 1300-1150 BC.References:&nbsp;Eogan, G.

It is decorated with embossed ribs and belongs to the embossed goldwork tradition (see Needham 2000a).The object is formed from a cylindrical band of sheet gold with no visible seams. In cross-section it has a corrugated appearance with eight bulbous embossed ribs, six decorating the body and two forming the rims. The ribs are evenly spaced with flat bands in between. The main body has four central ribs each swelling into lentoid-shaped bosses at seven points around the circumference, with the outer two ribs each flanked by a single, rounded rib. Along the centre (longest axis) of the lentoid-shaped bosses there are deeper grooves that connect with the encircling ribs. This suggest that the ribs may have been embossed first before the bosses were expanded out from them. The two rims are rounded, and the metal has been folded over. Needham (2000b: 23) suggests this may function to strengthen the overall object and possibly grip a backing material. DimensionsExternal diameter 85.78mm; width 61.3mm; weight 44.3g.ConditionThe object is mostly complete and largely maintains its original form. A small section is detached from the main body which may have been torn during its extraction. The area of damage on the main body is crumpled and a tear stretches diagonally towards the bottom rim. Metal compositionNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the gold armlet was undertaken by the Department of Scientific Research at the British Museum. It indicated a surface composition of approximately 83-85% gold, 15-17% silver, the rest being copper. These results are consistent with three other armlets analysed by the British Museum in recent years in terms of the gold, silver and copper contents (see Table). 						&nbsp;						Gold									Silver									Copper													North Turton (This report)									83-85%									15-17%									1-2%													Bewholme, East Yorkshire									82-84%									14-16%									1.5-2%													Lockington 1, Leicestershire 									87%									13%									0.1%													Lockington 2, Leicestershire 									85%									14%									0.3%						DiscussionThis Early Bronze Age gold embossed armlet belongs to Group 3 of Needham&#39;s armlet typology (2000b: 29-38). This is supported by the metal (gold) analysis noted above. Group 3 armlets of gold and copper alloy are unified by the presence of multiple ribs to decorate the body of the armlet (Needham 2000b: 31; also see Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014: 913-14, Tradition 4: Embossed goldwork). Needham assigned 11 armlets to Group 3 which was raised to 12 following the discovery of a gold example from Bewhome, East Riding of Yorkshire in 2016 (see 2016T683; YORYM-80ADC9) and the new discovery of the North Turton armlet brings the total to 13 armlets from Britain and Ireland. Within Group 3 there are now six examples made of gold with embossed ribs (including the North Turton armlet), one from the aforementioned discovery at Bewhome, two from the barrow cemetery site of Lockington (now in the British Museum; see acquisition numbers 1996,0901.1-2), Whititeld, Co. Waterford, Ireland (considered lost; Hughes 2000, pl. 19), and one from Cuxwold, near Caistor, Lincolnshire (considered lost; Hughes 2000, pl. 18) (see Hughes 2000, Appendix 1 for details).The North Turton armlet is comparable to several examples within the group, one being the Lockington 1 example (1996,0901.1) which presents a similar design of lentoid-shaped swellings at intervals along embossed ribs. Further similarities are that they were each constructed without a join and have wider ribs at the edges, serving to emphasise the rims. Further, their size and weight are comparable. However, the North Turton armlet does not share the additional pointill&eacute;&nbsp;decoration around the embossed ribs. Furthermore, the lentoid-shaped bosses are of a less sinuous form than Lockington and are more lozenge-shaped, although this varies between the bosses. Lockington:External diameter: 83.40 - 87.60mmWidth: 41.30 &ndash; 43.70mmWeight: 34.82gThe North Turton armlet has a greater width and therefore weight in comparison to the Lockington armlet. The weight of North Turton example is perhaps a little underweight considering the width is twice as large as that from Lockington, nevertheless, Needham and Sheridan (2014: 912) have noted that embossed gold armlets would likely have had organic backings which may explain the lightness of the North Turton find.The North Turton armlet bears further comparison with the Co. Waterford example. Although now lost, it is recorded through a drawing and notes in the Society of Antiquaries of London Catalogue of Drawings and Museum Objects (see Primeval Antiquities 29.1-2, available through the ADS). The Co. Waterford example illustrates a similar design of lozenge embossed ribs, although these appear more frequently than those on the North Turton armlet. Like the Lockington armlet discussed above, it is also recorded as having pointill&eacute;&nbsp;decoration around the embossed ribs and rims which the North Turton example lacks. The Co. Waterford armlet is smaller than the North Turton one, but has a smaller diameter and larger width than the Lockington example. The weight is not recorded.Co. Waterford:Diameter: 76.2mmWidth: 66.67mmWeight: UnknownA fragment of a bronze armlet from Masterton, Fife, presents a further example of the use of the lozenge rib design (see Needham 200b: 32-3, fig. 21a) and like the examples previously discussed, displays a pointill&eacute;&nbsp;decoration around the embossed ribs. The Bewhome and Cuxwold armlets have straight embossed ribs but also make use of the same pointill&eacute;&nbsp;design as the other discussed examples. The key differences between the North Turton armlet and those discussed is the absence of any pointill&eacute;&nbsp;decoration. However, this is not an anomaly as the Lockington 2 armlet also lacks pointill&eacute;&nbsp;decoration, as well a bronze example from Melfort, Argyll (see Needham 200b: 32-3, fig. 21b). The number of lozenge shape ribs on the North Turton example also bears some differences to other examples. Where the North Turton armlet has four lozenge ribs, the one from Masterton has two, that from Lockington has three and the one from Co. Waterford has five. This presents that there is no precise uniformity across the group and similar features will vary for each example.",1,,"ConclusionsThe object appears to have a composition of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old; it therefore meets the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the&nbsp;Treasure Act 1996.ReferencesGriffiths, R. 2016.

Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation, or radiocarbon dating, however, burials in Belgium, northeast France, and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and a longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing. Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores but there is no evidence visually that this is the case with this example.

More generally, there are a range of comparable ribbon gold ornaments known from the duration of the Bronze Age, particularly from the &#39;ornament horizon&#39; of the Taunton and Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007).&nbsp;&nbsp;This object also however&nbsp;finds parallels in its form within the earlier Bronze Age sheet gold tradition and an excavated example found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit along with a Beaker period flint scraper and pottery (Palmer 1980) suggests that an early Bronze Age date for this type of artefact is entirely possible. A number of similar objects have been reported as potential Treasure and are recorded on the PAS database, including HAMP-B9814B (2018T700), SUR-DE6DF2 (2017T644) and BH-1BE953 (2014T901).",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-31T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Hampshire,"Test Valley","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Hampshire Cultural Trust",1111965,images/smaslinhct/,HAMP0FCEE9.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,HAMP,2020-08-10T08:53:18Z,2022-12-19T14:37:22Z

Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003 opinion cited, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange?.",,,"In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Author: Arwen Wood, Finds Liaison Officer for BuckinghamshireContribution by: Ian Richardson, Senior Treasure Registrar, British Museum             References: Eogan, G. 1997. ?Hair-rings? and European Late Bronze Age society.

Finder has lost the artefact &ndash; Coroner is dealing with the matter.Discussion: All finds have been retrieved from the fields close to an Iron Age hillfort, an area encompassing a rare combination of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age sites, comprising one of the largest concentrations of burial monuments in England, the largest known cursus and a significant number and range of henge monuments. Other important remains include a variety of enclosures, settlements, field systems and linear boundaries dating throughout pre-history and into the Romano-British and Medieval periods. The socketed chisel is unusual but not without parallel. Examples are known from Middle Bronze Age hoards as at Highworth, Wiltshire (Taylor 1988, W71) Ongar Hall, Essex (Rowlands 1976: Hoard 43), and Taunton Union Workhouse, Somerset (Taylor 1988, SW71). They are also known in Late Bronze Age hoards at at Portfield Hillfort, Lancashire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981: plate 150), Roseberry Topping, Yorkshire(ibid plate 148) and in Derbyshire (see DENO-88980E).The collared awl has a parallel from the Carleton Rode hoard, Norfolk (Taylor 1988: EA45) and on the database in a hoard from Norfolk (PAS-9474B1) both of which are suggested to be Late Bronze Age in date. A chisel similar to (52) is recorded in database record WREX-8372FD where Dr Susie White notes: &ldquo;Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age. &nbsp;They have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales.&rdquo; For an example on the database see&nbsp;NMGW-E96F08.Other Bronze Age finds associated with this site include an axe fragment (HAMP-5DA054), a gouge (SUR-1536D1) and a sword (WILT-81D6A7). The gold fragments are largely undiagnostic, although it is possible they comprise part of a founder&rsquo;s hoard. Similar examples of such goldworking hoards are known from Britain including that at Fitzleroi Farm, Fittleworth (British museum Accession No. 1996,0902.26) and Cirencester (2004 T416).Due to the small size of the ingots, their full form is not clear and recent examples are usually thought to be undiagnostic as it has been accepted this form of ingot was used in several periods. However, before 2007 most fragments of ingots that had been hammered to thin them out before being snapped were thought to be Bronze-Iron Age in date, and the location of these finds would suggest that, on the balance of probabilities, a Bronze Age date is correct in this instance. Database examples include SOM-E5EF83 (2019T226), IOW-3C40219, CORN-50D181(2021T271).The clipped fragments are also likely to be late Bronze Age as similar clips occasionally show up with complete Bronze Age bracelets. Many such fragments are also recorded onto the PAS database: IOW-3CB691, NML-C0A809 (2022T357), and KENT-34916A (2021T635).&nbsp;Information from Dr Matthew Knight at Historic England suggests that the possible bent bar bracelet (1) can be broadly dated to the Late-Middle Bronze Age, c.1300-800BC, probably towards the later period. A number of fragments of gold rods of similar dimensions have been found in isolation and recorded by the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;e.g. KENT-A071A8 (2017T131), HAMP-8AFE65 (2019T1197), SWYOR-CBC05F (2019T849), SURR-3DE17A. Thanks to Dr Matthew Knight for his comments on the hoard.Conclusion:&nbsp; Most of the objects contain a minimum of 10% precious metal (the two copper alloy tools are linked by association) and are over 300 years old. Consequently, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Alix Smith, Finds Liaison Assistant for WiltshireSophie HawkeFinds Liaison Officer for WiltshireWith contributions by Dr Edward Caswell Finds Liaison Officer for OxfordshireReport updated December 2023",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-02T00:00:00Z,2023-11-23T00:00:00Z,"South West",Wiltshire,Wiltshire,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,1277766,images/sophaw123/,WILT-7EDEA6_664e0195f1aa6.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,WILT,2020-08-03T11:58:50Z,2025-01-28T10:51:28Z

Both ends appear to be breaks, and the strip has broken into two pieces post-recovery. Both long edges are folded making a thicker edge. About&nbsp;2.6mm - 2.8mm of the sheet is folded over on each edge. This flange is damaged and partially missing on one long edge, and partially unfolded. There is some modern damage on the outer face of the larger piece, in the form of transverse scratches across the face.

It is notably thin, measuring 0.4mm in thickness. The sheet has been pierced twice from the front, once on either end, after the decoration was applied. The piercing&rsquo;s measure at 1.6mm in diameter each. On one end of the strip, the two corner edges have been folded over onto themselves, giving the end a trapezoidal shape. The sheet has had eleven instances of linear stippled decoration applied in rows across its width via a circular shaped punch tool. It has been deliberately folded in between each row of linear stippling a total of thirteen times, which would have left the sheet in a tubular shape. It was subsequently unrolled by the finder at the time of finding, as they weren&rsquo;t aware of the deliberate nature of the folded state the piece was in.The gold is a rich, full, butter-like yellow colour, with small amounts of scratches visible on the surfaces exposed to wear. There are minor cracks present on the edges of some of the bends.Dimensions: Length: 44.6mmWidth: 12.4mmThickness: 0.4mmWeight: 2.2gDiscussion: Thin sheets of gold, often featuring piercings and adorned with lightly incised linework, punched repousse bosses or pointill&eacute; decoration are associated with examples of early gold metal working in Bronze Age Britain. The fact the piece was folded and manipulated in a deliberate and intentional manner, a known practice in the bronze age, further gives weight to this conclusion.The piece was originally reported to and identified by Mr. Peter Reavill, who has assisted Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen (Finds Liaison Officer for Dorset) with the recording of a particularly similar example, 2020 T825 (DOR-015978), found in Burton, Dorset. As of writing this record, the find is currently going through the treasure process. This example is also a thin strip of gold, decorated with linear stippled decoration applied in rows across its width, although this example hasn&rsquo;t been pierced. The record notes:&lsquo;The form of this gold sheet is similar to gold ribbons, plaques, mounts and other gold sheet decorations known from the British Bronze Age (2500-800&nbsp;BC) although it should be acknowledged that the form as such is not widely understood mostly due to the lack of discovery within excavated archaeological contexts. At present these objects fall into two distinctive groups those formed on thick and those formed of thin sheets. Those on thin sheets are thought to be of Early Bronze Age period (2150 &ndash; 1750&nbsp;BC) whilst those thicker may also be associated with Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150&nbsp;BC). The date and function and often referred to within the literature as ribbon ornaments. Both groups are decorated with repousse longitudinal bands or rows of applied indentations or bosses.This artefact (like most of the thin sheet examples) is most likely to be of Early Bronze Age date. These sheet mounts often have circular perforated holes on their terminal ends through which they are fixed &ndash; presumably onto organic elements &ndash; that we think form decorative pieces on personal dress (including scabbards, diadem headwear, neck (choker) or chest (pectoral) mounts).&rsquo;In addition to this, other similar examples of early bronze age gold plaques, ribbons or diadems have been recorded on the PAS database: 2021 T608 (YORYM-B1A82B) is a folded gold sheet with a single border line of roughly evenly spaced small, sub-circular applied repouss&eacute; bosses created by a circular headed punch. It has been dated to the early Bronze Age, c.2150 &ndash; 1750 BC, and has been processed as treasure. 2021 T975 (WMID-09EF95) also shares similarities with the record in question, namely the series of nine circular&nbsp;pointill&eacute;&nbsp;bosses formed with a round headed punch from the back of the sheet. This example has been dated from the early to middle bronze age and has been donated to a museum after being declared treasure. 2017 T798 (PAS-35C8A8) is a folded gold sheet with borders of pointill&eacute; decoration that has been dated to 2500 &ndash; 1500BC and has been processed as treasure. It has a tapered terminal which has been pierced in a similar fashion to the example in this record. Similarly, 2016 T521 (BERK-BA8440) also features the border of pointill&eacute; decoration and tapered terminal, except with three distinct piercings instead of a single one. It has been dated from 2400-2200 BC, and consequently has been processed as treasure. 2018 T700 (HAMP-B9814B) is an example of a plain, thin gold strip / ribbon / diadem with a tapered terminal and singular piercing which has been given a wider dating range of 2500 &ndash; 800BC, but is still considered to be Bronze Age, and has been processed as Treasure.Conclusion:Author(s): Peter Reavill, Former Herefordshire &amp; Shropshire FLOPeter Carey, Treasure Finds Liaison AssistantDate: 16th April 2024References:2020 T825 (DOR-015978) https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1012847#2021 T608 (YORYM-B1A82B) https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1037047#2021 T975 (WMID-09EF95) https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/10467972017 T798 (PAS-35C8A8) https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/973486#2016 T521 (BERK-BA8440) https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/791779#2018 T700 (HAMP-B9814B) https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/919630#",1,,"As of writing this record, this find represents one of the earliest examples of worked gold recorded in Shropshire.The piece has been found within the vicinity of the Britonnic ring, now in Ludlow Museum.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-18T00:00:00Z,2020-03-18T00:00:00Z,"West Midlands",Shropshire,Shropshire,"Restricted access",Bucknell,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","Shropshire Museums",1267446,images/petercarey/,HESH-E0D446_65f03837494cf.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,HESH,2020-04-20T21:59:48Z,2025-09-29T09:53:02Z

The very tips of the ends of each fragment fold over slightly and the two smaller parts fit the two ends of the larger, so it can be deduced that these snapped off through being bent. A near 90 degree bend is present halfway down the larger fragment and a split is visible at one of the fold&#39;s edges. Because the ends of the smaller fragment, which do not fit the larger section, are also bent slightly at the tips, it is likely that the original ribbon was longer and further breaks occurred at these points.&nbsp;Measurements:&nbsp;Fragment 1: length: 24.7mm; width: 6.7mm; thickness: 0.7mm; weight: 0.97gFragment 2:&nbsp;length: 12.6mm; width: 6.5mm; thickness: 0.6mm; weight: 0.34gFragment 2:&nbsp;length: 11.5mm; width: 6.4mm; thickness: 0.6mm; weight: 0.28gDiscussion:&nbsp;A number of gold strips of a similar size have been recorded as treasure on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, for example:&nbsp;2019T991 (DUR-9B1BA0), 2019T574 (BERK-B58065), 2014T777 (HAMP-36C41B), and 2014T63 (BERK-387817). Interestingly, the descriptions are broadly similar in that they are often folded or crumpled, with one &lsquo;original end&rsquo; that is smooth and rounded and one cut end that is sheared off. Some, but not all examples, have a small perforation at one end (e.g.&nbsp; 2014T6 (NMS-6E2A74), 2012T577 (ESS-C13B97), and 2013T326 (WILT-26F931) with two holes).It is not clear how these gold ribbons were used or what period of the Bronze Age they date to. Eogan (1994) referring to them as &lsquo;Tress&rsquo;-rings, included them in his discussion of gold working in the c.13th&ndash;12th centuries. One excavated example was found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit along with a Beaker period flint scraper and indeterminable pottery that was consistent with Beaker pottery (Palmer 1980). Similarity of the Oxford example with Early Bronze Age Scottish dagger pommel strips has been noted (Case 1980) but dismissed as it was missing the flange that was present on the Scottish daggers. Many of the examples reported as Treasure and subsequently recorded on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database (including several of those above) are accorded a date of middle to late Bronze Age (c.1500-800BC). However, based on the excavated contextual data the possibility that these strips date to the Early Bronze Age cannot be discounted.Conclusion: It is therefore clear that this object likely dates to before 1721 and, as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-31T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Kent,Thanet,"Restricted access",Manston,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,1157905,images/lrogerson/,2020T327.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,KENT,2020-04-16T16:04:35Z,2022-10-19T14:08:19Z

The sides of the axehead look slightly raised on both faces but that is because the original surface, which has turned dark brown in colour, has only survived around the edges making it look crisper, and also on the blade above the slightly expanded but worn and rounded cutting edge. The axehead is sub-trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the butt end. The blade narrows towards the damaged butt end, but with almost straight sides. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away. Similar slender flat axeheads with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar flat axeheads of Type Migdale from Scotland, Briach Moor and Morayshire on pp.41-42, pls.12-13, nos.143, 147 &155.Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of slender Migdale type flat axehead from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall on p.400 & 453, pl.1, no.6.Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Boscastle in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.3, 111 & 213.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-24T00:00:00Z,2020-02-24T00:00:00Z,"South West",Cornwall,Cornwall,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Returned to finder",,1096256,images/atyacke/,DSCN8545.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,CORN,2020-03-09T18:35:15Z,2020-03-11T18:01:38Z

This plate thickens and slopes upwards and is attached to a flaring tang which is triangular in plan but rectangular in cross section. The shank bends slightly to the break, and becomes thinner and more ribbon-like at this point. Dimensions: It is 17.38mm in length, 18.92mm wide at the plate, 1.26mm wide at the tang, 0.7mm thick at the plate and 1.49mm thick at the tang. It weighs 3.06g.Discussion:&nbsp; High carat gold is characteristic of Bronze Age gold working and the high shine and rich colour of this example are consistent with this kind of gold. The shape is reminiscent of Early Bronze Age/Chalcolithic gold &ldquo;basket ornaments&rdquo; such as BERK-0D1A05 (Byard 2012), and GLO-92912E (Adams 2019), which both display the same kind of design with a central tang flaring outwards to a flattened plate, giving the impression of a T-shape. However, in these examples, the plates generally have a more oval appearance, rather than the sharply angled plate present on this example. They are additionally generally more fragile and sheet like, with the Gloucestershire example measuring 0.2mm in thickness, significantly thinner than this Devon case. There is also no decoration on the Devon example comparable to that on other examples of &ldquo;basket ornaments&rdquo; which may have been worn in the hair, as ear ornaments or as items of decoration attached to clothing. It is more likely, therefore, that the fragment is from a different and much later class of object, namely a Middle Bronze Age ribbon torc terminal. The rectilinear shape in this example is not paralleled precisely, but there is a suggestion of a similar form in a damaged example from Hampshire (HAMP-1AE583, Hinds 2013). In that example, one of the now damaged terminals show signs of flaring widely at both sides creating a relatively similar fluke-like terminal which could be used to secure the torc in position. The Priddy Hoard (SOM-1C2C53 Payne 2007/ Minitt and Payne ) contained a group of 19 ribbon torcs of varying styles with a wide variety of terminals incorporating hooks and loops, and one example from that group also shows the same flared terminal, although not to the same angular degree. It is most likely to be of Middle Bronze Age date (1600/1500-1150 BC), perhaps more specifically of the Taunton phase &#39;Ornament Horizon&#39; (c.1400-1300 cal BC; cf. Roberts 2007), although it may be of later Bronze Age date and represent a later stage in more defined angular terminals. The relatively local comparable examples further support this conclusion. Conclusion: The fragment appears to consist of more than 10% precious metal and to be more than 300 years old at the time of finding, it thus qualifies as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South West",Devon,"Mid Devon","Restricted access","Silverton CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure",,1205972,images/bjw85/,DEVFAFCD2.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,DEV,2020-03-04T13:40:29Z,2025-06-10T15:45:59Z

Annular ring with sheet hasp wrapped around it that is decorated with incised horizontal, transverse and oblique lines within filled triangles between zones of four parallel lines in seven rows to form a herringbone pattern. The winged hasp has two&nbsp;tabs that continue the decoration from the plate on their undersides as they are&nbsp;curled outwards from the edge and would have slotted through the aperture or eye of another object, acting like a hook.An object&nbsp;with similar annular rings and attachment conical hasps&nbsp;was found at&nbsp;Kernoberon or Kernivin, in Ploneour Lanvern, in Finistere, France, and is illustrated&nbsp;in Avant Les Celtes (Le Goffic, 1988) on p.106, no.12.01.04 which are referred to as Pendentifs Cliquetants or Tintinnabulum, or&nbsp;&#39;little bells&#39; and dated from the Late Bronze Age. It looks as if these hasps might have held the three larger rings which have circular plates suspended from them.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;on display or was at the Musee de Chateaubriant in 1988.The decoration is similar to that on the upper bands of the gold bulla&nbsp;from the Bog of Allen in County Kildare, Ireland, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age (Eogan, 1994, p.89, pl.XIX) and one section of the decorated&nbsp;cup-ended ornament from Morvah, Cornwall illustrated in Taylor (1980) in pl.56, d, which dates from c.1000-800 BC.

There are four gold granules or&nbsp;balls, 1.3 mm in diameter,&nbsp;applied at one end of the plate and raised borders on each side of the upper face of the plate along with a central rib that are 0.6 mm in thickness. The plate is plain and smooth on the back.&nbsp;See&nbsp;GLO-E9EC16&nbsp;for a record of the Woolaston&nbsp;hoard from Gloucestershire with&nbsp;similar tabs and hooks&nbsp;on the ends of a bracelet that is dated from c.1500-1100 BC.There is a bracelet with a wrought buffer terminal and applied bosses, which have then been hammered flat,&nbsp;between ribbed borders in the British Museum (see https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_AF-410) that is now suggested to be from France as it is a French type and is dated from the Late Bronze Age (Mary Cahill pers comm).There is also what might be an&nbsp;Etruscan bulla from the Redmond Antony collection in Mary Cahill&#39;s paper on The Man in the Bulla in Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2018, which has similar traits to&nbsp;three of the objects in this hoard:&nbsp;the plaited annular ring (no.6) around the circumference of&nbsp;the domed mount (no.7) and the granulated strip with the three ribs and the tabs to connect it as a suspension&nbsp;loop for&nbsp;the bulla like this piece.Length 30&nbsp;mm; width 6.4&nbsp;mm; thickness 1&nbsp;mm; weight 0.87&nbsp;g13.

The form corresponds to Hook and Needham&#39;s (1989) Class B1 bracelet (which may or may not have the flanges). Hook and Needham list 21 examples of Class B1 and related bracelets from Britain and Europe, with a clear concentration of the type in southern England and with a band stretching across north Wales and Cheshire.The parallel from Potterne is of very similar form and is similar in &nbsp;width at 8.25 mm. Other examples of the Potterne type have been found at Llanarmon-yn-I&acirc;n in Denbighshire (Green 1984) where a heavily worn bracelet with smaller terminals but of the same type was found with other gold items (a bracelet, an ingot and a link) and deposited within the socket of a faceted axe of type Gillespie. Excavations at Brean Down, Somerset revealed an associated pair of Potterne Type bracelets and possibly a small fragment from a third. The Brean Down examples are also more slender with maximum widths of 8.2 and 9.2mm. The dating of this bracelet type can be confidently placed in the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 7 and dated to 950-750 BC. The Llanarmon-yn-I&acirc;n bracelet was associated with a faceted axe of Ewart Park date, the Potterne find is thought to have been associated with the settlement rather than the midden with a suggested date in the mid 8th century&nbsp;BC. The Brean Down finds may be slightly earlier with a proposed date within the 10th-9th centuries&nbsp;BC&nbsp;(Bell, 1990 pp.71, 108).However, eight of the objects (4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 &amp; 14),&nbsp;which is over half the objects in the hoard, can be typologically dated to the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 BC) of the Late Middle Bronze Age so there is some suggestion of possible curation of artefacts or that they are focused in an area where continued activity in gold working or trade in gold objects spanned several hundred years.See record&nbsp;HAMP-8A11A7&nbsp;for a hoard which contains two Bronze Age gold objects from different phases, a composite ring and a lock-ring, apparently deposited in the 2nd or 1st century BC, so providing a useful precedent for the gold objects of mixed chronology in this hoard (Dr Brendan O&#39;Connor pers comm).It is hoped that the hoard will&nbsp;be analysed by Professor Gregor Borg using a non-destructive&nbsp;pXRF spectrometer at the Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany as part of the Cornish gold project in association with the analyses of the Nebra Sky Disc as a fragment of a worked piece of gold from the Middle Bronze Age.This hoard is an unusual one, both in the identification of the objects it contains and in its overall composition. While some of the objects can be identified as characteristic British Bronze Age types, others cannot. And even the identifiable types do not seem to be chronologically consistent, which is unusual for hoards of Bronze Age gold from Britain. It would thus be desirable for the contents to be analysed to establish whether or not the compositions of the individual objects are consistent. This might also help to judge whether any of the unusual types might be of exotic origin or significantly different date (Dr Brendan O&#39;Connor pers comm).",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-10T00:00:00Z,2020-04-08T00:00:00Z,"South West",Cornwall,Cornwall,"Restricted access","West Cornwall",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1095921,images/atyacke/,IMG_20200308_1740259.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,CORN,2020-02-26T23:56:49Z,2025-05-20T09:31:08Z

The edges of the strip appear to have been cut rather than broken, suggesting that the object is complete. The strip has been folded almost exactly in half, with a small portion left uncovered. The outermost side is decorated with numerous fine, straight, 'incised' grooves, whilst the inner side remains undecorated.Dimensions:Length (folded): 16.5mmWidth (folder): 9.2mmThickness (folded): 1.2mmThickness (sheet): 0.5mmWeight: 0.9gDiscussion:The linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, including finds from Sherborne St John, Hampshire, The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005). Given that it is similar to strips that usually have a greater length; it is not inconceivable that the Retford find has been cut from a longer strip.It is possible that the object was once tubular, in which case it may have formed a gold bead or similar (e.g.a fitting folded around the edges of another object). Elure provides a number of French examples of such beads ('perles tubulaires lisses': 1982, 29, figs. 24-7). An example from Bern, Switzerland is twice the length of the putative Retford bead and is decorated with grooves separated by undecorated surfaces (British Museum WG 468). Undecorated cylindrical gold beads have also recently been discovered in a Chalcolithic Beaker burial from Kingsmead Quarry in Berkshire (S.

A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the PAS database as LVPL-83FE92. There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England. Other Bronze Age gold strips found singly such as at Flixton, Yorkshire (British Museum 2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16, no. 2) are broader and have more and narrower incised grooves. The annular ring from the Late Bronze Age hoard at Abia de la Obispalia, central Spain is comparable in form and dimensions but the grooves appear to have been incised rather than embossed (Almagro Gorbea 1974). Similarly, the Bronze Age annular ring from Armissan, southeast France may be comparable (Elure 1981, 48-49, fig. 55).As this fragment is older than 300 years in age, with a precious metal content of greater than 10%, it should be considered as potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.ReferencesAlamagro Gorbea M. 1974, Orfebrera del Bronce Final en la Peninsula Ibrica.

It consists of:	4 socketed axeheads, one of which is near-complete	1 gouge	1 sword blade fragment	1 possible casting waste	3 rectangular lead objects, possibly ingotsCatalogue:1. Almost-complete socketed axe with double mouldings at socket, the fainter lower moulding is in line with the top of the side loop. The mouth of the socket is rounded and sub-square, tapering into a rectangular cross- section as the blade constricts to the slightly flared cutting edge. No hafting ridges were seen in the interior of the socket. Outer mould seams of the casting have been quickly finished but are still visible, especially at the socket mouldings and loop.The cutting edge was damaged in antiquity with an old, patinated break to one side of the blade; further (but minimal) recent edge loss has occurred and now appears a light green colour. Other localised patches of this surface loss are confined to the upper socket moulding, loop and small areas of the body of the casting. The main patination is otherwise dark brown, with rusty, iron oxide deposits adhering to the surface.Length 95.6mm, maximum width 44.4mm, thickness at socket 37.6mm. Weight 220g.2. Incomplete, facetted, socketed axe with one main moulding to the top of the socket; a second, fainter moulding is just visible below, in line with the top of the loop. The socket is sub-oval in cross-section with no hafting ridges visible. The lower portion of the socket is filled with soil which may include possible remains of the wooden handle. The side loop has triple mouldings along its length, one to the middle of the seam line, and one either side of the loop; the inside of the loop also has a slight ridge, though this is where the two halves of the mould join. The exterior mould seams have been worked, though they still stand marginally proud of the surface.The blade was broken across in antiquity, and is now patinated dark brown with slight iron oxide deposits to the surface. Minimal surface loss to the ridges of the body and socket now appear light green.Surviving length 80mm, width at break 38mm, thickness at socket 32mm. Weight with retained soil, 143.2g.3. Incomplete, almost square- to rectangular-section socketed axe. The mouth of the socket is double moulded, the lesser, lower moulding is in line with the top of the side loop. Below this are four vertical ribs moulded into the surface on both faces, starting to fade into the surface of the axe at the break. No internal hafting ribs are visible. The cutting edge is missing, broken across; the break is unworn but patinated the same colour as the surviving surface. The lower part of the break is partially filled with iron oxide deposits, as is one side of the upper surface of the side loop. The two valves (halves) of the mould used to cast this axe were misaligned; this is very noticeable on the loop. The casting seams are reduced, yet still visible and stand proud of the surface slightly. Similar patination as axes 1 and 2.Length 65.8mm, width at loop 46.3mm, thickness at socket 43.9mm, weight 188.4g.4. Fragment of an axe, the cutting edge only, broken across the bottom of the socket which is now partially filled with iron oxides. Patination as before; the recent light green losses to the surface are confined to the crescentic and gently expanding cutting edge and only lightly to parts of the break.Surviving length 25.4mm, width 46mm, maximum thickness 13mm. Weight 43.3g.5. Complete socketed gouge of typical elongated form. It has a circular cross section at the socket with no collar or mouth mouldings. A little less than halfway down the object, a longitudinal concave groove begins and runs down flaring to a semi-circular cross-section which forms the cutting edge at the other end. Patination as before, though the surface is a little more pitted, probably due to the casting rather than post-depositional degradation.Length 89.4mm. Socket outer diameter is 18.6mm, inside diameter is 13.7mm. Width across cutting edge, 16.9mm. 54g.6. Short length of sword blade, part of the width constriction between the main expanded, leaf-shaped blade and the handle. It has a thick cross-section with a convex centre which changes smoothly to concave towards the cutting edges. The edges themselves are recently damaged, with light green patination and no step visible to the (now missing) thin edges. Where undamaged, it has a dark brown patina. The same colour covers the unworn, granular breaks at either end as well, suggesting these are old breaks.Surviving length 40.4mm, maximum width 27.5mm, thickness 9.7 mm, weight 37.6 g.7. Bun ingot, irregular lumpen surfaces with some air bubbles within. One side is roughly convex and the other is almost flat. Grey/green patination with light brown sandy soil adhering in the hollows. There are no obvious breaks.It measures c. 45 x 45mm and is 19mm thick. Weight 132g.8. Rectangular lead possible ingot, neatly cast with rounded edges and a slight concavity to each face. Patination is off white with mottled brown iron oxides adhering, Slight abrasion to some of the edges showing as white or light grey compared to the original surfaces.34.5 x 31 x 12.5 mm, 107.8 g.9. Rectangular lead possible ingot of slightly larger size than 8, neatly cast with rounded edges and a slight concavity to each of the sides, the largest two faces are flat. Patination is white with very light brown speckles to one of the large, flat faces.38.8 x 31.8 x 15.3 mm, 180.8 g.10. Rectangular lead possible ingot of slightly larger size than 8 and 9, neatly cast with rounded edges as before, though the outside edges are straight, rather than convex. One main face is flat, the other has an off-centre depression, this appears to be ancient rather than post-depositional damage, as the surface is covered with rusty covered iron oxide deposits. The rounded edges are slightly abraded, and the off-white patination of the lead beneath is showing, one of the larger faces has lost a large proportion of its rusty coating.45.8 x 42.6 x 12 mm, 178.9 g.Discussion:AxesAxe 1 is of relatively plain form, with the only decoration being the double moulding at the mouth and just below at the socket. It is the most complete of the axes in this hoard, and is of typical plain South-Eastern type (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, pl. 85, nos. 1272-1290; Needham 1996 type A, sub class 1 plain). Ewart Park Phase (c.950-800 BC). See LVPL-201FD7 for a similar type.Axe 2 is of sub-octagonal cross-section and facetted form. Although the cutting edge was broken at the time of deposition, the remnants of the handle appear to be still attached within the socket. The break is slightly bent to one side, as if the axe twisted and broke while in use. Type Meldreth (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, pls 82 to 83, nos. 1222-1252). Ewart Park Phase (c.950-800 BC). See NLM-6A5B21 and OXON-84347A for other examples of this type.Axe 3 is of a pronounced square or rectangular cross-section, and of heavy build. The two sides are decorated with multiple ribs and the mouth is double moulded. Again, the cutting edge is missing, broken away before deposition. Type Sompting, Variant Roseberry Topping (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, pl. 103, nos. 1615-1622). Llyn Fawr Phase (early Iron Age, c.800-600 BC). See HESH-5C40D5 for a broadly similar type.Axe fragment 4 is a broken cutting edge which is not part of any of the other axes in this hoard. It is of a fairly standard type with slightly flaring, crescentic blade. As such a small, plain part remains, it is difficult to assign a type, though it is likely to be of the Ewart Park to Llyn Fawr phase (c.950-600 BC).GougeThis is a gouge of standard form. The lack of collar or mouth mouldings suggests it is likely to be a later type; see LEIC-6E2039 for a brief discussion. Ewart Park phase (c.950-800 BC).Sword fragmentOnly a small fragment of the blade of a sword was recovered, with old breaks at either end. The exact type is difficult to ascertain, but likely to be Ewart Park type, South-Eastern Step 1 to 4, Ewart Park Phase (c.950-800 BC).Bun ingotThe rough shape of the ingot 7 is recognisable as being at least part of a bun ingot, broadly diagnostic of the Late Bronze Age. Their distinctive plano-convex shape is due to the use of a bowl furnace to initially produce ingots from the raw copper-rich ore. They are normally roughly circular, and although there are no obvious breaks on this one, it is less regular in shape and may be incomplete. See KENT-14DDA6 for a complete example.The three lead itemsLead was increasingly used as an alloy in Bronze Age castings, with some Late Bronze Age axes containing upwards of 15% added lead (Timberlake 2016). Despite this, it is rare to find objects made from pure lead; exceptions include two earlier (middle Bronze Age) lead palstave axes, perhaps models used to make two-part moulds, recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database at DENO-A24823 and KENT368. There are also occasional lead-filled hollow items, such as the rings and socketed axe in hoard KENT-7C3863, and the socketed axes in hoard NARC-77BD13.Objects thought to be Bronze Age lead ingots are even rarer. A very few Late Bronze Age hoards include possible lead ingots, and those recorded on the PAS database include: HESH-9EC8BE (2018T769), a flat lead sheet used to wrap a pair of gold lock-rings; KENT-7DA0B5 (2004T228), two lead &lsquo;objects&rsquo;, one perforated; and ESS-F88237 (2018T659) a piece of lead casting waste. None of these is similar in shape to the three ingots from near Dereham, however, and their shape is not diagnostic of Bronze Age ingots.The hoard as a groupIt appears that many of the items were buried with contemporary breaks and parts missing, probably in order to store them safely until the metal could be melted down and reused. The gouge, being complete, may have been redundant and destined for recycling. The function of the three lead rectangular blocks remains obscure; although it could be suggested that they were there to be added to the recycling crucible if needed, the great rarity of lead ingots in the Bronze Age suggests that they may have had another, less utilitarian, function.Date: Most of the datable items within this hoard are from the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age, c.950-800 BC. The most recent object is axe no. 3, a type known from the Llyn Fawr phase of the earliest Iron Age, c.800-600 BC, and this item&rsquo;s date-range must represent the rough date of the hoard&rsquo;s deposition.",1,,"It is likely that the objects form a single find of Late Bronze Age date, which qualifies the group as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,2020-01-29T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,Breckland,"Restricted access","Near Dereham",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1297443,images/awilliamsnorfolk/,NMS-2D00AD_670f9edc9e080.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2020-01-30T12:46:02Z,2025-10-09T15:38:17Z

The corrosion likely indicates that it was made by covering a circular copper-alloy bar with gold sheet and hammering it flat, giving it the appearance of being made from solid gold. The ring was decorated with silver or silver rich gold wire, which covers the ring in a continuous spiral that provides a striped effect. The stripes are extremely thing and measure about 0.75mm in maximum width. The gap between the terminals is approximately 1.93mm. Overall, it is in very good condition, but there are a couple of dents in the surface, as well as scratches and nicks in the metal.Dimensions: Diameter: 18.50mmThickness: 7.15mmWeight: 11.4gDiscussion: A number of penannular rings of similar size and decoration have been recorded as treasure on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, for example: 2012TW4 (NMGW-928F55), 2013TW13 (NMGW-04216C - from a hoard), and&nbsp;2015T94 (SUR-8A4184). See also: https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/objecttype/PENANNULAR%20RING/broadperiod/BRONZE%20AGE/material/23/) for a full list. It is not clear how these rings were used. In the past they were called &lsquo;hair-rings&rsquo; because they were thought to have been worn in the hair and they have been called &lsquo;ring-money&rsquo; as they were thought to have been used as a proto-monetary exchange object and used in trade. However, there is no evidence for either of these uses. Although use as hair decoration has been ruled out, the possibility remains that they were worn on the body and used as personal adornment (e.g. as earrings or nose-rings). Eogan&rsquo;s (2004) distribution shows that Bronze Age penannular rings are found in both Britain and Ireland and a small number have been found in northwest continental Europe. Finds recorded on the PAS database for England and Wales reflect a general bias towards southern Britain, with very few recorded in Wales and northern England. As this example was found near Darlington, it is a rare addition to the northern distribution of penannular rings. It is the first example of the striped type to be recorded on the PAS database in the north (other examples are of other types: 2011T499 (LANCUM-80A136) and 2015T978 (DUR-EC189D)).&nbsp; A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). This particular example comes under their &lsquo;Type 3d gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo; and analysis of a similar one in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex. These penannular rings, especially the gold sheet examples with stripes, are generally considered to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;800BC; Needham 2007, 33).

Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however, burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997).Other similar penannular rings are recorded on the PAS database and constitute treasure including 2017 T810 (LANCUM-C2543F), 2014 T113 (CAM-5B1D08), 2012 TW4 (NMGW-928F55), 2014 T730 (NLM-129434) and 2013 T739 (BH-D0CF18).

The surviving terminal is round in cross section and is between 3mm and 5mm in diameter. The end of the terminal displays a slight double depression which is likely to have been caused during the manufacturing process. The terminal tapers slightly before it joins the twisted hoop. Four longitudinal cuts have been made into the bar to create an X-shaped cross-section and the bar has then been twisted. The edges of a number of the twists are dented, probably due to post-depositional factors. The torc is now very distorted; the terminal has been straightened out and there are three bends within the hoop. There is slight nick towards the junction with the hoop. The break in the twisted hoop is very sharp and is therefore likely to be modern. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis carried out by the British Museum&rsquo;s Department of Scientific Research indicated a surface composition of approximately 75-77% gold, 18-20% silver, the rest being copper. Dimensions:Length (max.): 147mm, length of terminal: 61mm, diameter of terminal: 3-5mm, diameter of twisted hoop: 6mm, weight: 33.39g.Discussion:Gold flange-twisted torcs are dated typologically to the Penard phase (c. 1300-1100 cal BC) of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007, 141). This is supported by their inclusion in a number of&nbsp; hoards such as the Lambourn Hoard (Roberts 2007, No.77), Towednack Hoard (Roberts 2007, No.4) and Grunty Fen Hoard (Taylor 1988, EA18)They are found in the south of England, including East Anglia. A complete example is in Norwich Castle Museum (acc. no. NWHCM : 1947.5.1) and a second found at Ashill (Norfolk) is in the British Museum (acc. no. 1866,1201.1).There are two similar examples on the PAS database: NMS-5E3BC2 from Great Dunham (Norfolk) and NMS-894CFF from Trunch (Norfolk).Gold metalwork from the Bronze Age is rare from Essex, and there are no previously reported finds of torcs on the PAS database. This would appear to be an outlier of a group of finds with a distribution further north in the East of England.

The ring has been manufactured from a sub-circular copper alloy bar over, which a thin sheet of gold has been applied and hammered flat, thus giving the appearance of being made of solid gold. It has been decorated with silver, or silver rich gold wire, which covers the ring in a continuous spiral giving a striped effect. The stripes are extremely thin and measure about 0.8mm in maximum width, whilst the gold sheet is approximately 0.25mm thick (measured at the damaged terminal). The gap between the two terminals is approximately 1.79mm. There is damage to one terminal, exposing the interior copper-alloy bar; however, the ring is in otherwise good condition with a small number of nicks and scratches in the surface. &nbsp;Dimensions: Diameter: 20.70mmThickness: 8.32mmWeight: 15.4gDiscussion: There is no clear consensus in terms of how these penannular rings may have been used in the past.

Although it is unlikely they were worn in the hair, the possibility remains that they were worn on the body and used as personal adornment (e.g. as earrings or nose-rings). Eogan&rsquo;s (2004) distribution shows that Bronze Age penannular rings are found in both Britain and Ireland and a small number have been found in northwest continental Europe. Finds recorded on the PAS database for England and Wales reflect a general bias towards southern Britain, with very few recorded in Wales and northern England. This particular penannular ring (2019-T1012/ DUR-1B2FA1) fits generally with this distribution pattern. A recent scientific analysis of penannular rings categorised the rings into four broad types based on their components and decoration (Meeks et al. 2008). As such 2019-T1012 (DUR-1B2FA1) as Type 3d: &lsquo;gold foil plated copper alloy ring, with silvery gold wire inlay&rsquo;. Analysis of a similar example in the British Museum collections suggests that the technical skill involved in creating the fine silver-rich gold striped effect on the surface was highly complex. A number of penannular rings of similar size and decoration are recorded on the PAS database and have been declared Treasure according to the criteria of the Treasure Act (1996), including 2012TW4 (NMGW-928F55), 2013TW13 (NMGW-04216C - from a hoard), and 2015T94 (SUR-8A4184). Penannular rings of this form, particularly gold sheet examples with stripes, are generally considered to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000&ndash;800BC; Needham 2007, 33).

The ribbon is a thin rectangular sheet of gold. One side is decorated with thirteen regular, longitudinal, incised grooves whilst the other side is plain. The long edges are slightly thicker, giving it the illusion of another two grooves. The ribbon is folded almost half-way down its length with the undecorated sides facing.&nbsp; One end of the strip is finished with slightly rounded corners, perhaps implying the original finished edge, while the other appears to have been cut. Dimensions: Length (folded): 31.16mm, Length (unfolded): 66.91mm, Width: 10.44mm, Thickness: 0.52mm. Weight: 3.8gDiscussion: A number of gold strips of a similar size have been recorded as treasure on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, for example: 2019T574 (BERK-B58065), 2014T777 (HAMP-36C41B), and 2014T63 (BERK-387817). Interestingly, the descriptions are broadly similar in that they are often folded or crumpled, with one &lsquo;original end&rsquo; that is smooth and rounded and one cut end that is sheared off. Some, but not all examples, have a small perforation at one end (e.g.&nbsp; 2014T6 (NMS-6E2A74), 2012T577 (ESS-C13B97), and 2013T326 (WILT-26F931) with two holes). It is not clear how these gold ribbons were used or what period of the Bronze Age they date to. Eogan (1994) referring to them as &lsquo;Tress&rsquo;-rings, included them in his discussion of gold working in the c.13th&ndash;12th centuries. One excavated example was found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit along with a Beaker period flint scraper and indeterminable pottery that was consistent with Beaker pottery (Palmer 1980). Similarity of the Oxford example with Early Bronze Age Scottish dagger pommel strips has been noted (Case 1980) but dismissed as it was missing the flange that was present on the Scottish daggers. Many of the examples reported as Treasure and subsequently recorded on the PAS database (including several of those above) are accorded a date of middle to late Bronze Age (c.1500-800BC). However, based on the excavated contextual data the possibility that these strips date to the Early Bronze Age cannot be discounted.

The ring is oval in shape and the terminals are flat ended.&nbsp;The ring is cracked and chipped in several places where the inner copper alloy core has corroded underneath, and the terminals have become joined by corroded metal. Dimensions: Diameter: 15.3mm, thickness: 4.1mm, weight: 3.48gDiscussion: A gold-plated lock ring of a similar style on the database (LANCUM-C2543F) that is Bronze Age in date was submitted for consideration as treasure (Treasure case tracking number: 2017T810) and includes the discussion: &lsquo;This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997).However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple &#39;hair-rings&#39; of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, &#39;hair-rings&#39; have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal&nbsp;BC&nbsp;and 1373-1019 cal&nbsp;BC&nbsp;respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).&#39;Hair-rings&#39; are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O&#39;Connor et al 2008;&nbsp;DCMS&nbsp;2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Elu&egrave;re 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O&#39;Connor et al 2008). There are a number of examples known from Wales, Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, &#39;Carmarthenshire&#39;, Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 &amp; 15).LANCUM-C2543F is the first complete example from Cumbria and the only other complete example known from the North West is from Wrenbury practically on the Welsh border. There is another broken example from West Cumbria manufactured from gold sheet rolled into a tube with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 80-82%, silver content of 14-15%, with at least 4% copper. The ring is formed from gold sheet rolled into a curved tube, with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. According to Gillian Varndell Curator, Department of Prehistory and Europe, British Museum. It is probably part of a well-known Bronze Age ornament type (composite ring) dating to c.1300-1100&nbsp;BC. This find is also close to other gold finds from West Cumbria from a similar period consisting of a penannular bracelet and three lock rings. These finds are very significant for the North West in terms of high status Late Bronze Age activity.The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 &amp; Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.",,,"As the object is over 300 years old and contains more than 10% precious metal, it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act.Lori Rogerson, Database Volunteer, Essex",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eastern,Essex,Chelmsford,"Restricted access","Woodham Ferrers and Bicknacre",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Chelmsford Museum",1161332,images/lisapittjones/,2019T1068.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,ESS,2019-10-22T11:40:38Z,2023-04-14T16:25:07Z

A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham & Sheridan 2014, 908-9).

From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.See CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).

Post-medieval.29 Pottery fragment.Glazed body sherd. Post-medieval.Discussion: The Eggleston hoard is comprised of 5 socketed spearheads, 1 socketed knife, 1 tanged knife, 4 hollow decorated terminals decorated with concentric circles, 3 pins, 1 fragment of decorative gold foil, 3 amber beads, and 1 jet bead. There was also 2 iron fragments and one large sandstone fragment, but due to the nature of the recovery of the artefacts, it is not clear if these were intentional inclusions. Also recovered was: 1 flint burin of Mesolithic date, a fragment of clay pipe stem, and a glazed pottery sherd.In addition to the metalwork and beads made from amber and jet, there are organic finds associated with the hoard. The socketed knife and one of the hollow decorated terminals have wooden still in-situ with pegs intact. An additional fragment of wood was associated with another terminal, but it has since become loose. Also of interest are the remnants of twisted string with two of the decorated terminals.The objects from this hoard are consistent with a Late Bronze Age date of the Ewart Park phase (c.1020-800 cal BC) (Needham et al. 1997, 93). There are four other hoards found in west County Durham that are comparable to the Egglestone hoard: Heathery Burn Cave hoard (Greenwell 1894), the 1980 Gilmonby Hoard (Coggins 1983), and two further hoards from Gilmonby (2015T566/DUR-1F5057 and addendum 2017T550/DUR-4E1468; 2016T611/DUR-308251).The pegged leaf-shaped spear is a known type of the Late Bronze Age. The nearly complete example (no. 2) is the largest in the group, while the remaining spears were probably smaller. Spear nos 4 and 5 had blades that were not as wide as spear nos 3 and 6, which were much wider. Despite the differences in size, all of the spears seem to be neatly made with a long mid-rib that reached the tip of the blade and would have had well bevelled edges. Two of the spears (nos 2 and 3) retain enough of the socket to show that they were pegged and a similar method of attachment seems likely for the others. The two fragments of iron (nos 19 and 20) may have been pegs for the spears. However, there does not seem to be enough fragments of copper alloy to form the other half of the socket for no. 4, as well as the missing parts for nos 5 and 6. Therefore, it is possible that spears 5 and 6 were broken in antiquity and not all the fragments were interred together at the time of deposition. The breaks on spear nos 2 and 3 show a core of purple-red material on the interior (possibly lead?). Other local examples of this type of spear were found in the Gilmonby hoards (see above) and, Heathery Burn Cave hoard (Greenwell 1894). Burgess (1968) also notes examples from Denwick, Northumberland and the Kilnhurst hoard, Yorkshire.Two knives were present in the hoard. Although visually the blade sections of both knives appear to be very similar, they would have been hafted using different methods. The socketed example (no. 8) is a 'Thorndon' type (Hodges 1956, 38) and is slightly smaller of the two. Significantly, it has two opposing peg holes on the socket, with pegs and wood fragment intact. This is a classic example of this type of knife, as the blade edges are parallel with each other and with the socket edges. Hodges (1956, 38) noted a heavy bias towards Southeast Britain in the examples he catalogued. There is a growing number of examples on the PAS database, but the distribution is favoured by the Southwest, particularly around Bristol, Somerset, and Wiltshire. Hodges noted two examples in the north and there are now two other northern examples on the PAS: DUR-850CB6 and SWYOR-CAF110, suggesting that these are still rare finds. Recent examples of this type of knife have been found during excavation, which are broadly similar (West 2014, cat. no. 5; Skelton 1987, 53, cat. no 2). Another similar, but longer, socketed tool was found in the 1980 Gilmonby Hoard, but it was described as a socketed mortice chisel (Coggins 1983, cat. no. 64).The second knife is a tanged type (no. 9). The surviving blade portion is slightly longer and wider than the socketed example (no. 8) and also has parallel edges until it tapers at the tip. Hodges (1956, 39) described tanged Late Bronze Age knives as 'without rivet-holes, and have a cast rib running down the middle of the rectangular tang'. The blades are the same shape and proportions as the socketed knives of the Thorndon type with examples with a perforated tang being from the Middle Bronze Age. However, no. 9 does not have a rib along the length of the blade.An unusual inclusion in this hoard is a set of four decorated hollow terminals (cat. nos 10-13). All four were nearly identical in size and shape. They each had a circular face decorated with a series of raised concentric circles with a central raised dot and appear to have been cast in one piece. Each had a connection flange on one side, although this area was the most damaged and on some examples had completely broken away. Two of the terminals (nos 10 &amp; 11) were associated with worked pieces of wood. On terminal 11, the wood was found in-situ inside the terminal with a rivet and there are fragments of fibrous string (likely plant based) wrapped around the wood. Terminal No. 12 had fibrous string adhering to the inside of the hollow body kept in place by the soil infill. It is not clear what these objects were used for, but a decorative end mount to some other composite material object seems likely. However, the copper alloy is very thin, and even though the worked wooden pieces would have provided some structural support, they would have been quite delicate. Close parallels with other Late Bronze Age objects are not immediately apparent. The concentric circle design is a common motif found on later prehistoric artefacts. Two decorative objects were found in the Horsehope, Peeblesshire (Piggott 1952-53, fig. 1 nos 3 and 4) hoard with concentric circles, but the attachment is on the back face rather than the side. A similar, but half-circle, terminal with pegged connection flange was found in the Home Wood Farm, Kent hoard and has been shown reconstructed as the pommel of a sword (Wickhams 1877, Plate C no. 18; in the British Museum collections: 1894,0803.49).Other artefacts included pins, beads, and ring fragments. Two different types of pin were included: two examples of flat headed type (cat. nos 15-16) and one with a domed head (cat. no. 17). Two amber (cat. nos 21 &amp; 22) and a single jet bead (cat. no. 23) were found in the hoard. They were all of a similar size and shape. The ring fragments probably make up at least two rings (cat. no. 14). There was also a Mesolithic burin (no. 26), two fragments of iron (nos 19 &amp; 20), a fragment of clay pipe (no. 28), and glazed pottery (no. 29) recovered at the time of the hoard's discovery.Acknowledgements: Thank you to Brendan O'Connor for directing me to the Horsehope, Peeblesshire hoard and Home Wood Farm, Kent hoard.Author: Elizabeth Foulds, Assistant Finds Liaison Officer for Durham, Darlington &amp; Teesside, with minor revisions by Benjamin Westwood, Finds Liaison Officer for Durham, Darlington &amp; Teesside.Date: 25/11/2019ReferencesBurgess, C.

The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina.

From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.See CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).

The function of these objects remain relatively unknown, having been possibly identified as currency for exchange, or ornaments worn by people to display wealth and power.Many of these penannular rings have a copper alloy core wrapped in gold sheet. Although it is not clear if this is the case for this example, as there are no chips or brakes showing the core, it is very light which indicates it is probably gold plated.

The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap.

A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.Authors: Lydia ProsserFLO for Lancashire and CumbriaNeil WilkinThe British MuseumMary CahillNational Museum of Ireland Galway",,,"In terms of the date and precious metal content of this object, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"North West",Cumbria,Copeland,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Tullie House Museum",1065609,images/lydiaprosser/,LANCUMC6B5FC.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,LANCUM,2019-07-15T13:02:39Z,2024-11-18T14:33:31Z

Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B Dimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.This is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragmentDimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.This is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.Fragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)Dimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.This is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.There are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)Dimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.This is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.There are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D Dimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.This is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.The sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.The molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).The axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)Dimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.These are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. The socket end (visible on fragments 6 & 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.Fragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,with a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.All fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)Dimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.This is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.There is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11Dimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.This is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.The spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.The fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable swordDimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.This is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.The breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.The fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner formDimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.This is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.The jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner formDimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. This a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.The jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.14. Copper alloy annular ringDimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.This is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.The ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning capDimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.This is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.The object is covered in a dark green patina.This object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. 16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slagDimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.This is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.This piece is covered in green corrosion.This slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards.",1,"National importance","BibliographyAudouze, F. & Courtois, J.-C.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. It measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

Both ends of the strip end in clean transverse terminals which are slightly expanded. It is not clear whether these terminals represent the original length of the object or whether this has been damaged although have almost no sign of damage such that the former is more likely.The object is a bright gold colour. There are numerous scratches and dents on its outer surface and no signs of decoration.Dimensions: In its current state the bracelet is 104.2mm long. The strip has an estimated original width of 23.3mm, and original thickness of 3.0mm and weighs 63.3 gramsDiscussion: Being so warped the piece has only a few diagnostic features including a crescent cross-section and relative robust thickness. Similarly bracelets are held in the British Museums Collection originating from the Bexley Heath hoard, Kent (Museum number 1906,0709.9 also see Eogan 1994: plates 8-9), Tisbury, West Sussex (Taylor 1988: W79; Museum number AF.400) while other examples have been found in a hoard from Cottingham, Yorkshire (Eogan 1994: plate 12), Colaton Raleigh, Devon (Taylor 1999) and Rosemorran Farm, Cornwall (Knight et al. 2015: No.40). Each of these hoards contains gold bracelets with a similar thickness and cross section to this example. Often these have large everted terminals. This example possibly lacks the same terminals although one does begin to turn outwards and both may be truncated.&nbsp; Furthermore those hoards cited above are notable for containing multiple gold bracelets with several different forms including plain terminals. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that this item fit the same tradition of metalworking seen in this period of these hoard&rsquo;s deposition. Each of the hoards above are thought to date to the Ewart Park stage of the Bronze Age (see Eogan 1994 chapter 5 and references above) which dates to c.950-800 cal BC (following Roberts et al. 2013) which would be supported by the presence of similar items in the South Cadbury hoard (Pearce 1983 No. 731).Conclusion: &nbsp;The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Dr Edward CaswellFinds Liaison for Oxfordshire16th February 2022BSibliography:Eogan, G.

The ribbon is sub-rectangular in plan and made from a sheet of gold. One side of the ribbon is decorated with eight regular, longitudinal, incised grooves. The other side of the ribbon is plain with some light scratches. The ribbon is folded almost half-way down to face the reverse side and folds again at the terminal which has rough damaged edges. The damage is not new. The other end has a neat, flat-ended terminal with sharp 90 degree corners. There is a circular perforation at this end of the ribbon on the fourth and fifth ridge which is slightly off-centre. The diameter of the perforation is 1.1mm. There is an indentation on one edge of the ribbon by the terminal. On the decorated side of the ribbon, the perforation is surrounded by a lip and on the back of the ribbon it is surrounded by a shallow recess indicating that the perforation was punched through from the reverse side. The opposing end of the ribbon is also square-shaped but the edge has been bent over back to rest toward the perforated side of the ribbon. It is a little rough around the edges. There are also some longitudinal scratches and scuff marks on this plain side of the ribbon.Dimensions:Length: 17.8mmWidth: 6.6mmThickness: 3.93Weight: 1.3g.Discussion: A similar grooved, pierced gold ribbon is recorded under Treasure number 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97), and other similar types of ribbons include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5).The incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and &#39;ribbons&#39; of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).Conclusion: Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-01-06T00:00:00Z,2019-01-06T00:00:00Z,"South East","West Berkshire","West Berkshire","Restricted access",Inkpen,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","West Berkshire Museum",1068296,images/helenacostas/,BERKB58065.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,BERK,2019-06-20T10:55:18Z,2022-10-19T14:13:10Z

This item, possibly hair ornaments or ear rings, has been cut from thin gold sheet and would normally have been wrapped into a cylindrical 'basket' shape. This example has been flattened out and shows the full extent of the oval plate which is 38mm long and 16mm wide with semi-circular ends and long straight sides. The interior of the plate is decorated with two concentric lines that run around the outside, inside of this are four zones of about five to six vertical lines running perpendicular to the long edges. This plate is heavily damaged with extensive creasing at either end, plus an off centre crease that runs the length of the plate. Protruding for the centre of one of the long edges is a long and thin (21mm long, 2.5mm wide) tang that would have ultimately been wrapped around the rolled cylindrical plate. As with the plate the tang is heavily creased.An almost exact parallel was found in South Oxfordshire 2012 T774 BERK-0D1A05, but also see BERK-F548E6, SUSS-096CEB, LON-FF7E65 and BH-956274This class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain.

Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period. Whether worn on hair, ears or items of costume, they were rolled into a basket shape in use.In shape and decoration this example falls into Needham's Atlantic Group B (ii) (Needham 2011).

The rings and awl were&nbsp;discovered within a few feet of each other.The penannular rings are in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop that tapers slightly towards the terminals. One of the rings is plain. The other is heavily corroded on the surfaces but appears to have ribbed decoration.The uncorroded ring is 16.9mm in diameter, with a thickness of 5.7mm and a weight of 8.14g. The corroded ring is 19mm in diameter, 7mm thick and weighs 11.41g.The probable Bronze Age awl is circular in section and tapers to a blunt point at one end and a rounder point at the other. The surface has a dark green patina with some small areas of fine pitting.The awl measures 85.2mm in length, a maximum of 4.2mm in diameter and weighs 6.88 grams.Awls are difficult to date but most are probably the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). &#39;Awl&#39; is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as &quot;pointed punches&quot; by Coles (1963-64 117), they were presumably used for perforating leather.As a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002). They note that although most awls are associated with leather working, some would have been used in woodworking, bone working and other crafts.",,,"Conclusion:&nbsp; As the penannular rings are Bronze Age in date and made of gold, they qualify as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

In both cases the gold is very pure, with a slightly pitted surface of a solidified fluid and bases that are flat suggesting they were poured or dropped onto a flat surface when molten. One piece is slightly rougher on its surfaces having ragged breaks on all sides barring its base. The high purity, pitted surface and solidified fluid form confirms that this gold has been (re)worked rather than being an example of a naturally occurring nugget of gold ore. Piece 1 is 45.5mm long, 31.3mm wide, 9.5mm thick and weighs 48.92 grams Piece 1 is 15mm long, 10.2mm wide, 14.1mm thick and weighs 14.19 gramsDiscussion: The form of this object is undiagnostic meaning it is difficult to date with certainty, although other finds in the area have been dated to the Bronze Age (see below). Similarly undiagnostic examples on the database have been found from Yorkshire (2018 T986), the Isle of Wight (IOW-41DA55) and Cheshire (LVPL-B3875C). Conclusion: On balance of probability, the two objects are likely more than 300 years old, and being composed of more than 10% precious metal, fulfil the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.Note: This group of artefacts was found within several hundred metres of two other assemblages of likely Bronze Age material: references 2019 T426 (a copper-alloy axehead and 10 piece of gold) and 2019 T617 (a bent and twisted gold bracelet).

These are discussed below.1) An incomplete cast copper alloy flat axe or chisel of Early Bronze Age date (c. 2000 - 1700 BC). The axe probably best fits within the Migdale metalworking traditionThe object is sub-trapezoidal in plan expanding from one broken terminal, marked by an irregular transverse break, down most of its length before narrowing again at an incomplete crescent blade edge. This blade is missing a chip at one of its wings, giving it a diagonal edge and has chips along is edge. The object is rectangular in cross section and profile thickening only slightly towards its centre.The fragment has a medium green patina that is pitted and chipped with several parallel scratches running diagonally across its body on one side which may be the result of movement in the ground.The fragment is 50.6mm long, 30.6mm wide, 5.1mm thick and weighs 31.09 gramsThis axehead is almost identical to an example from a Hoard found in Cornwall (2018T617) described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the undecorated variant) based on a parallel illustrated by Pearce (1983: no.587) from Banner Down Somerset. This form of axehead is suggested to date from 2250-1900 cal BC (Needham 2017). The axe matches Needham&rsquo;s (2017) class 3 (possibly 3D Type Barton Stacey) a having narrow thin butt, lenticular profile, moderate haft end expansion, sides with gentle curvature, and broad mid-blade and cutting edge. Also being flat (as in having no raised flanges or stop ridge) which is dated to this same time period. Further examples on the database include HAMP-3781B6, CORN-3237B8 and CORN-7ACDD7.Gold fragments2) Fragment of scrap gold placed in same bag as the axeA broken fragment of a gold ingot dating to the Bronze Age. The fragment has ragged breaks at both ends and a sub rectangular to trapezoidal cross section, with irregular edges characteristic of being hand worked. Both edges are beveled and the surfaces are undecorated.The fragment is 8.6mm long, 8.1mm wide, 3.1mm thick and weighs 1.81 grams3) A broken fragment of a gold ingot dating to the Bronze AgeThe ingot is sub-rectangular in plan, with one rounded end and another that ends in an ragged transverse break. It has a sub rectangular to trapezoidal cross section, with irregular edges characteristic of being hand worked. Both edges are beveled and the surfaces are undecorated. There does appear to be a contraction point close to the break marked by a wide (c.2.2mm) transverse lines visible on both wide surfaces possibly the result of being clipped at this point.The fragment is 15.3mm long, 8.9mm wide, 4.1mm thick and weighs 5.70 grams4-11) 11 fragments of scrap gold. The largest fragment (4) is thick at one ragged break but then widens and flattens down towards it second ragged transverse break. It is 21.4mm long, 20.2mm wide, 4.8mm thick and weighs 8.88 grams5 is an irregular fragment that is 13.9mm long, 11.7mm wide, 2.9mm thick and weighs 2.22 grams6 is an irregular fragment that is 11.7mm long, 8.1mm wide, 1.9mm thick and weighs 1.31 grams7 is mostly flat with slightly upturned edges and is 11.2mm long, 6mm wide, 1.5mm thick and weighs 0.72 grams8 is an irregular fragment that is 7.1mm long, 5.8mm wide, 1.8mm thick and weighs 0.42 grams9 is an irregular fragment that is 7.1mm long, 5.4mm wide, 2mm thick and weighs 0.67 grams10 is an irregular fragment that is 7.5mm long, 6.6mm wide, 1.5mm thick and weighs 0.57 grams11 is an irregular fragment that is 8.9mm long, 6.5mm wide, 1mm thick and weighs 0.49 gramsDiscussion: The axehead can be confidently dated to the Early Bronze age specifically&nbsp; c.2250-1900 cal BC. The fragments associated with this abject are varied in form and shape but&nbsp; are all appropriate fragments that could have been cast into various other objects. The range in shapes and forms is very similar to that seen in a larger hoard from Fitzleroi Farm, Sussex held by the British Museum (Museum number 1996,0902) which was dated to the Middle Bronze Age based on the inclusion of objects (bracelet) specifically the Ornament Horizon (c.1400-1100 cal BC). Gold working assemblages are also known in the Early Bronze Age most notable at Upton Lovell (Shell 2000).Conclusion: Many of the object are a minimum of 10% precious metal and are likely to be over 300 years old. These are associated with one copper alloy object. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content and also being a collection of more than one metal object buried in association.Dr Edward Caswell, Finds Liaison Officer, OxfordshireBibliographyNeedham, S.P.

At the break, the shaft of the torc is bent upwards slightly, ie, out of alignment with the terminal; this probably represents damage rather than the original shape. (compared with intact examples of bar torcs such as British Museum number 1932,0511.2 ) The surface of the break has a flat, sloping component, which may suggest it was cut. The break does not appear to be fresh.Apart from the bending associated with the break, there is no evidence of twisting of the bar, which was a common decorative feature of Bar Torcs (Eogan 1967, 8 - 12 ) It is possible that the terminal was fashioned as a separate piece and attached to the bar by a collar, as in the case with the east Cambridgeshire torc, described on this database in record CAM-E5D871, but no evidence of a collar or other means of attachment can be seen.The eight-facetted cross-section appears to be unusual, most bar torc terminals are circular or square in section.

Cast pegged and socketed spearhead, retaining the end of a wooden shaft within, which is now pale brown in colour and fibrous in its appearance. The spearhead takes the form of a regular cone with opposed flanges forming blades which extend from the pointed tip for 71mm, or to 21mm above the mouth of the socket. Opposed drilled holes are set 9.4mm, or half way between socket and flanges, and are aligned with them. One of these holes is of 4mm diameter; the other retains the burred head of a rivet of diameter 4.4mm. Three finely incised circumferential lines immediately below them may have served to set out the holes. Above them, a zig-zag pattern of elongated dots - or perhaps dashes given the form - produces a series of six triangles between the rivet holes and a seventh carried over the occupied hole, with each triangle of height 4mm. A further two circumferential lines of dots are carried around the socket mouth below the triplicated continuous lines.The outer cutting edges of the blades are lightly abraded, showing a green tint against an overall brown patina, and along with limited abrasions on one side of the object these are the only indications of deterioration or damage. As with other objects of the period hereabouts, the spearhead appears to have been deposited in working order. The practice of ritual &#39;killing&#39; of an object does not seem to figure here.The triplicate decoration combined with zig-zag motifs recurs in WAW-C65A09, a spearhead recently reported from Warwickshire. That example is held to be of later Bronze Age date, 1150-600 BC. In this case, the relative proportions of blade and socket are different, with more blade and less socket. A stubby peg-hole spearhead from Burton on Stather, North Lincolnshire, displayed in the North Lincolnshire Museum, more closely resembles this example, and is ascribed to the Early Bronze Age, probably c.1600BC or thereafter.Suggested date: Middle to Late Bronze age, 1600-800 BCLength: 94mm, Width (at blade): 24.5mm, Diameter (socket): 22.6mm, Thickness (wall, at mouth of socket): 1.7mm, Weight: 50.20gms",1,,"This object gains in importance from its apparent association with other objects, including a gold bangle or torc, and axe heads of Early, Middle and Late Bronze age form, reported from the vicinity.

This pattern of deposition may follow the model of a &#39;persistent place&#39; as advanced by Dr Adam Daubney with reference to Lincolnshire, an observation kindly offered by Dr Kevin Leahy. However, with objects so far dated to between the Early Bronze Age (2350-1600BC) and the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC), it would imply this to be a cultic centre of greater longevity than any Christian holy place in Britain. The model may also cut across those interpretations associating Later Bronze Age metalwork deposits with the margins of encroaching wetlands in periods of climatic change.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-01-31T00:00:00Z,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","North Lincolnshire","North Lincolnshire","Restricted access","near Brigg",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder",,1046114,images/mforeman/,NLM41578.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NLM,2019-02-14T13:53:44Z,2023-06-21T11:27:22Z

The axehead is sub-triangular in plan, lenticular in section and in profile, 59 mm in length, 30 mm wide at the blade end and 18 mm wide at the butt end, 7 mm thick and weighs 40.75 g. At 59 mm in length the axe is about a third of the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axehead from South West England. The sides are straight but not parallel and expand outwards towards the blade end which is crescentic in plan. Half of the surface is covered in a dark brown skin of corrosion product with some deep pits revealing copper-coloured layers beneath, and there is no evidence of any form of incised decoration on the surface of the axehead. The butt end and the opposite cutting edge has been damaged through movement in the soil since deposition but the sides are still untouched showing the cast edges, which suggests that the axehead was never used. The size of the axehead makes it difficult to haft and would also render it useless for chopping and the blade would not be suitable for chiselling either.The larger of the two flat axeheads (2018 T617b) is sub-triangular in plan, lenticular in section and in profile. At 89 mm in length the axehead is about half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axehead from South West England. It is 41.6 mm wide at the blade end, tapering to 20 mm at the butt end; its maximum thickness is 6.7 mm and its weight 101.9 g. The sides are straight but not parallel and expand outwards towards the blade end which is curved in plan. Much of the surface is covered in a brown skin of corrosion product with some pits revealing light green bronze disease, and there is no evidence of any form of incised decoration on the surface of the axehead. One face has been damaged by a sharp blade that has created a diagonal groove across the entire face. The cutting edge is also damaged through movement in the soil since deposition and there are scratches in perpendicular directions on one face where the skin has been removed from abrasive action, exposing some of the original surface. On either side of this damage, some of the original cutting edge of the blade survives, suggesting that the axehead was never used as a tool.Pearce (1983) describes a miniature Migdale (Sutherland, Scotland) type flat axehead, with an expanded blade like 2018 T617a, from Banner Down, Somerset on page 502, which is illustrated in pl.69, no.587 and a wider, broader Migdale type flat axehead with straight sides like 2018 T617b, from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall on page 418, pl.12, no.98c, which are both associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Schmidt &amp; Burgess (1981) discuss Migdale flat axeheads on pp.35-45 and the Biggar variants, with their straighter sides and less rounded cutting edges, on pp.46-48. These are illustrated in plates 5 to 19. A similar Migdale miniature flat axehead to 2018 T617a with a more crescentic blade is illustrated in pl.22, no.266, and similar narrow small flat axeheads of the Biggar variant type to 2018 T617a, with a more expanded blade, and to 2018 T617b with a shallow curve to the blade, from Caithness and Yorkshire, are illustrated in pl.19, nos.235 &amp; 241.There are similar miniature Migdale type axeheads recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a &#39;Biggar&#39; variant of the Migdale type of flat axehead, with slightly crescentic blades like 2018 T617a, and similar small flat axeheads to 2018 T617b recorded in HAMP-3781B6, CORN-3237B8 and CORN-7ACDD7.These axeheads all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996, p.122) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).

(Geen 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65 Varndell 2001).

However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing Raftery 2004, 87-8). that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC). The very narrow gap on this example may suggest it is part of the group thought to be made from bent gold rod, such as 2006 T451 (Scott 2007) dated to circa 1300-1150 BC rather than the main group of Later Bronze Age penannular rings.Many penannular rings are composite with copper alloy cores but there is no evidence visually that that this is the case with this example.Conclusion: The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Edward Caswell, Finds Liaison Assistant for Somerset & Devon, March 2019Checked by Neil Wilkin, Curator of the Bronze Age Collections, British Museum, December 2019ReferencesEogan, G. 1997. ?Hair-rings? and European Late Bronze Age society.

It comprises a collared socket below which the body widens gradually from 29.5mm to c.34.8mm down most of its length before flaring more in sharp concave curves to form a winged crescent blade that has a maximum width of 43.9mm It has one integral attachment loop.&nbsp;The mouth of the axe is sub-rectangular, with internal dimensions of 23.7mm (depth) by 20.8mm (width). No casting stubs are evident on the mouth which is smooth and rounded possibly from being finished. The socket of the axe is empty such that it is possible to identify that it is triangular in profile, as is the outside of the axe, and has a depth of c.47.7mm.Expanding from just below the mouth is a prominent and well-defined moulded collar giving the socket a maximum width of 33.2mm and depth of 33.1mm. Beneath this is a plain by a second smaller but still clear collar spaced 2.2mm below the first. Three longitudinal raised lines extend from this second collar on each of the wider surfaces of the axe blade for c.20.8mm.The side loop extends from the second collar. The loop is oval in section; it measures 16.6mm in length, is 8.1mm wide, 3.4mm thick and projects 7.4mm from the body of the axe creating a D-shaped hole between it and the body of the axe.The object has a medium oragey brown glossy patina which may indicate it was buried in waterlogged conditions. Prominent unfinished casting seams are visible on the outside of the narrow surfaces of the axe running from the socket to just before winged blade edges. Further potential casting seams are visible on the interior of the socket in the middle of the wider surfaces of the axe for its length. The blade of the axe has chips to its patina but no clear marks that may be the result of use and no evidence for sharpening.The axehead is 64.7 long 43.9mm wide, 33.1mm thick and weighs 105.80 grams.The diagnostic elements of this axehead are its small size, double collar, three decorative lines extending from the lower collar and internal casting lines. These are all traits that Schmidt and Burgess attribute to the Yorkshire socketed axe type (1981: 223). There are numerous examples of this form of axehead illustrated by these authors (1981: pl 89-99) which are suggested to date to the Ewart Park Phase (ibid 238).2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An incomplete bent and intentionally broken cast copper alloy Ewart Park sword dating to c. 1000-800 cal BC. Only a small part of the tang, and cross guard are missing to abraded and worn breaks. Otherwise the sword is complete but broken into four parts by two transverse breaks across the sword blade and one more across its grip.The sword&rsquo;s hilt and grip are made of a broadly sub-rectangular plate. The grip&rsquo;s sides are slightly convex widening from a diagonal break at its base to 20.8mm and then contracting to 15.5mm just below the hilt in smooth curves. The diagonal break truncated a central rivet hole (c.5.5mm diameter), probably placed just above its butt in half. Extending from the top of the grip is the sword&rsquo;s hilt. One side of this is truncated by a vertical break although it likely mirrored the opposite side which extends 16.2mm from the outside edge of the grip before narrowing again in a straight line to the sword&rsquo;s blade so as to form a point. An oval rivet hole (c.5.5mm by 5mm) is placed just inside and below this point on each side of the hilt, one of which has been cut in half by the break. The blade extends from the hilt and first narrows slightly to c.2mm wide. Beyond this the the sword blade is leaf shaped having edges that first expand for three quarters of its length to c. 37mm wide before narrowing to a point in a smooth arc. The blade is vesica shaped (pointed oval) in cross section at each of its breaks. The center of the sword becomes more prominent down its length as the blade edges become wider and creating an almost convex midrib.The blade has been bent close to it hilt with the regions indicating where the bend begins and ends being marked by transverse breaks.&nbsp;The sword mostly has a smooth orange patina possibly indicating being buried in water logged conditions, with some regions beneath having a more medium green colour. There are chips along the blade edge although it is not possible to tell wether these are chips from damage to the patina or use,The sword is c.50m long, 41.3mm wide at the hilt and weighs 460.1 grams,This is a Ewart Park sword containing all the diagnostic features of this type including the lead shaped blade oval cross section, lozenge shaped ricasso and shoulders and a bulging hilt. Colquhoun and Burgess (1988) have identified 4 stages in the development of this sword throughout the Ewart Park period which go in order although the juncture between each step are uncertain. This sword posses traits that would best group it within step 2 having rivets holes in the hilt, broadly straight shoulders and ricasso a bulging hilt and most notably flanges which appear to extend beyond the hilt onto the shoulders.3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An incomplete hollow-cast copper alloy annular rings Dating to the Late bronze Age / Early Iron Age. The ring is oval in plan (internal dimensions being 38.3mm long and 32.5mm wide) and made of body that is oval in cross section (13.1mm wide, 10.6mm thick).The object has been truncated by a transverse break across the hoop revealing a hollow core (now filled with soil. The ends of this break are marked by the only decoration visible on the ring which may suggest this break occurred due a weakness in a feature projecting from this region rather than it continuing to be annular in shape. This decoration is molded consisting of slight thickening of the hoop, creating two liner lips between it and the rest of the hoop where it begins and ends. There is also one further prominent crack on the hoop, pitting and occasional scratches. Beyond this the object has a glossy dark brown patina&nbsp;The loop is 38.3mm long, 32.5mm wide, 10.6mm thick and weighs 52.38 gramsThe ring is similar to copper alloy rings found in the latest Bronze Age hoards as at Parc-y-Meirch (Sheppard 1941L Pl III), Heathery Burn Hoard (Britton and Longworth 1969), Hagbourne Hill Hoard (Coombs 1971), Green End Road (University &nbsp;of Cambridge Museum for Anthropology and Archaeology Nos. 31.395 and 31.396) and Horsehope &nbsp;Manor, Peebleshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 146, nos. 3&ndash;94)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A complete cast copper alloy strap slide fragment from a Bronze Age strap fitting.The piece is made of a long and thin rectangular strip of copper alloy that is crescent shaped in cross section with a convex outer surface and concave inner surface. The two ends of the strip have then been folded over 180 degrees in smooth arcs to create hooks which have flat cross sections. The outer surface of the object has a glossy dark green patina while the interior is still encrusted with soil.The strap fitting is 50.8mm long, 6.5mm wide, 2.0mm thick in the sheet and 7.4mm thick including the curved hooks. It weighs 4.81 grams.5)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A fragment of a cast copper alloy strap slide fragment from a Bronze Age strap fitting similar to object 4.The piece is made of a long and thin rectangular strip of copper alloy that is flat in cross section. One end of the strip has then been folded over 180 degrees in two sharpish right angled turns to create a hook. The outer surface of the object has a glossy dark green patina while the interior is still encrusted with soil.The strap fitting is 12mm long, 5.5mm wide, 2.0mm thick in the sheet and 6.8mm thick including the curved hook. It weighs 1.02 grams.6)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A near complete cast copper alloy spiked object possibly a Late Bronze Age awl.The object has a circular socket with a projecting integral spike. The socket&rsquo;s edge is chipped and abraded with a circular cross section (c.15mm diameter) which has been left open so that it is possible to identify its depth (c.30.4mm) and that it is broadly straight sided within it. The socket&rsquo;s plate has one pierced hole (c.4.0mm diameter) placed just above its mouth.. After 38.8mm the object contracts to 9.3mm in diameter, creating a vertical ledge on all sides, from this platform a spike extends which narrows down its length (c.33.5mm) to a sharp point with a sub-circular cross section.The object ha a dark brown sometimes orange patina that is glossy.The object is 75.3mm long, 15mm wide and weighs 27.06 gramsBrendan O&rsquo;Connor has been able to identify a similarly shaped item from Pigeon&rsquo;s Cave in Northern Wales. This was found associated with Bronze Age material dating to the Late Bronze Age (details available from https://museum.wales/collections/bronze-age-gold-from-wales/object/bfb4924f-2b99-3957-8fea-563ae35ac966/Late-Bronze-Age-socketed-awl/). This shares the same broad form and has a consistent patina with those objects in the hoard such that a Ewart Park date is also suggested for this object.&nbsp;Discussion: The objects above can all be parallel with objects from Bronze Age hoards dating to the Ewart Park Phase of the Bronze Age. These parallels extends from Wales to North East England and are consistent in date. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the objects listed above were deposited as a closed group over 2000 years ago during a single event.Conclusion: The objects detailed above qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002), being a group of more than one base-metal objects, other than coins, of prehistoric dateBibliography&nbsp;Britton, D., and I.

The gold sheet appears to have impressed decoration running in broadly parallel lines down its length. The torc is made of a rod that is square in cross section with accentuated corners created by slightly concave edges. This has been twisted tightly but unevenly across its surviving length. These twists end c.10mm from one terminal where the rod becomes sub-square almost oval in cross section and narrows to a blunted irregular point.",,,"Discussion: Similar examples to the twisted spiral torc fragment are illustrated by Eogan (1994: pl.4) and Taylor (1980: pl.41) who term these Gold &ldquo;bar&rdquo; and &ldquo;flanged twisted&rdquo; torcs. These have been dated typologically to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Eogan 1994: 69, 74, 91; Roberts 2007: 141) albeit with the suggestion they may overlap into the preceding Taunton phase (ibid), when twisting and flange twisting bars and ribbons of gold were common techniques in Britain (Taylor 1980: 60) and in Europe (Armbruster 2021: 156-8). Torcs of this style are most common in southern England and East Anglia, but do occur elsewhere in Wales and central Britain (Roberts 2007: fig.4). Deliberately cut fragments like this occur relatively often in&nbsp;&nbsp;hoards such as the Salcombe hoard, Devon (Needham et al. 2013)and the Fittleworth hoard, West Sussex (British Museum number 1996,0902.21) and occasionally as stray finds (e.g. treasure case 2003T19,&nbsp; 2016T203 and 2011T501).&nbsp;The object this wraps around has numerous Bronze Age parallels recorded on the database variously known (based on their complete form) as ribbons (2019T383, 2021T937), mounts (2021T608) and plaques (2020T332) with one example also possibly coming from a lunulae (2017T405). These are all dated to the Bronze Age and often paralleled to objects dating to the Early Bronze Age supported by similar examples dated to this period by Taylor (1980, pl 28) although similar techniques are also seen on Middle Bronze Age gold&nbsp; bracelets (e.g. 2013T805).As such the two items together can be dated to the Bronze Age with the twisted torc placing this in the Middle Bronze Age c. 1300-1150 cal BC.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-10-21T00:00:00Z,,"South East","West Berkshire","West Berkshire","Restricted access","Near Newbury",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","West Berkshire Museum",1111376,images/helenacostas/,BERK8F4E07_2018T1028.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,BERK,2018-12-18T13:23:44Z,2025-04-15T10:16:33Z

The first ring is in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop (15.0mm wide by 14.0mm high) and has a circular cross-section frame that is the same diameter (2.8mm) along its whole length. Both terminals have a shallow rectangular shaped recess in the centre of their face. There is a thick scar that runs along the top edge of the penannular from the right-hand terminal to just beyond the midsection of the frame.The second ring is a similar form being an oval-sectioned loop (15.2mm wide by 13.9mm high) and has a circular cross-section frame that is the same diameter (4.2mm) along its whole length, although it is notably thicker than the first ring. As with the first ring. both terminals have a shallow rectangular shaped recess in the centre of their face. On one surface there is a scar that runs along at least half of the top edge of the penannular from the left-hand terminal to just before the midsection of the frame. The other half of the ring shows corrosion across all sides that is possibly indicative of its original manufacture method.Dimensions: The first ring is 15.0mm long, 14.0mm wide and 2.8mm thick. The gap between the terminals is c. 3mm and it weighs 3.57g. The second ring is 15.2nn long, 13.9mm wide and 4.2mm thick. The gap between the terminals is 4.0mm and it weighs 5.88gDiscussion: &nbsp;These penannular rings belong to a class of artefact which have in the past been given various terms such as &#39;hair-rings&#39; (Eogan 1997) and other monikers such as &lsquo;Ring Money&rsquo; (Geen 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65 Varndell 2001). Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.They are given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008,&nbsp; 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing Raftery 2004, 87-8) that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC). The items were found about 20 meters of SOM-4D34ED/ Treasure case 2018T14, a bi-partite gold penannular ring of similar date. The presence of a scar on the items and their proximity to the bi-partite penannular ring suggest these rings may each have been one half of a similar double ring, although their variable thickness suggests that they were not mounted to each other. Further examples of two gold or gold-plated penannular rings, stacked one on top of the other, can be found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: DENO-A13440, IOW-1F5D46 and&nbsp;HAMP-471843. It is highly likely that the two rings reported here and SOM-4D34ED/ 2018 T14 are associated finds from a hoard or archaeological deposit that have become dispersed by subsequent agricultural action.Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores (See Green 1988 or Ashby 2007 for examples) but there is no evidence visually that that this is the case with this example with no copper corrosion showing through in the scratches on the rings. Conclusion: The penannular rings appear to be over 10% precious metal and more than 300 years old and as such qualify as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

The object is U-shaped in plan and comprises three integral sections. One consisting of extending arms, a rod shaped mid piece, and a warped flattened section.The bar has a rectangular cross section that is 4.3mm long, 4.0mm wide and 3.1mm thick. From one end of this bar the bar splits into four separate strands that each takes up half of two sides of the bar. Each strand narrows from this triangular profile to become flat being c. 3.6mm wide and c.1mm thick. Three strands extend broadly in straight lines for c.8mm before ending in transverse breaks. The fourth is longer extending in the same direction for c.8.2mm before turning over 180 degrees to create a loop that carries on over each of the other strands, being flush to the uppermost of these. The opposite side of the rod is bent and twisted but it is possible to suggest it was originally flattened into a wider, flatter strip of gold than the rod shaped mid-section that has since been bent and warped. This bending includes, the folding inwards of the sides, to initially create a new rod shape with a gap at its top that is bent over its length over 180 degrees so that the whole object is broadly U-shaped in plan.Dimensions: In plan the object is 19.9mm long, 13.0mm wide, 5.8mm thick and weighs 5.59 grams.Discussion: The object has been truncated bent and warped such that its original form can only be suggested from the surviving features. Most notably is the splitting of the rod form into four strands which are closely spaced with flat edges. These are particularly similar to features seen on flange twisted torcs dating to the Ornament Horizon of the Bronze Age (c.1400-1100 cal BC) (see Roberts 2007, O&rsquo;Connor et al 2017 and Wilkin 2017). In particular this example shows a good resemblance to a fragment held by the British Museum (Museum number: 1996,0902.21) truncated on both ends but which has been squashed to form a rod like form much like the rod terminal on this example. As such this object may have come from a &ldquo;flanged twisted&rdquo; torc (see Eogan 1994: pl 4 and Taylor 1980: ok 41 for complete examples). These have been dated typologically to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Eogan 1994: 69, 74, 91; Roberts 2007: 141)Conclusion:&nbsp; The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

The find was made in the field adjacent to the gold ?bulla?/pendant (Treasure case 2018 T343). The findspot is considered to have been a wet environment during the Late Bronze Age, although investigations into the exact nature of the prehistoric environment and landscape are ongoing. In early September 2019, fieldwork was undertaken at the site, close to the findspot of the Treasure case, by Dr Ben Gearey (University College Cork) and Kristina Krawiec (Trent & Peak Archaeology). At the time of writing the results of the fieldwork were not yet available. Description:This unusual find comprises of a lead sheet that has been used to wrap two gold ?lock-rings? - ornaments probably worn in the hair or clothing as jewellery (see Eogan 1969, 95-6; 1994, in passim). The act of wrapping the lock-rings in a lead sheet was clearly intentional and served to hold the gold lock-rings in place. Soil and other organic material can be seen in patches within the ?parcel? and need to be retained for analysis in conjunction with the ongoing fieldwork analysis. The lead sheet has number of holes across its surface which appear to be ?natural? rather than intentionally perforated. These holes may be the result of production, when the lead sheet was cast as an oval-shaped plate either for use as such a wrapping or as an ingot for trade and exchange. The edges of the sheet appear ?lipped? in places; it is not clear how this formed but it may be a result of the way the lead has been cast (i.e. an ingot in a mould) rather than representing the use of the lead as an object per se (e.g. the bottom of a container) which seems unlikely (see Discussion). There are a number of deliberate cuts to one end of the parcel. Judging from their presence on difficult surfaces, these appear to have been made after the sheet was wrapped around the gold lock-rings and before deposition. On the ?bottom? of the parcel is a small modern dent caused by the finder at the time of discovery. Its presence supports the suggestions (made by the finder), that the surface of the parcel on which the lock-rings are visible was facing downward when discovered. Completeness and condition: An X-Ray image of the parcel revealed that the gold lock-rings were placed in the parcel as complete objects, possibly in good condition at the time but were crushed in the act of wrapping. The lock-rings overlap one another, the top lock-ring (?A?) is therefore more visible than the lower ring (?B?) which is partly obscured by ?A?. The face-plates of both lock-rings, some traces of the core of one (?A?) and the edging of both lock-rings are visible, while other components: central tubing and side plates are either not visible or difficult to make out among the crushed gold. In the case of lock-ring ?B?, the ?c?-shaped tubing has come away from the face-plates, highlighting the way in which it was applied and the use of a strip of gold fashioned into a ?c?-shaped used to bind the two face-plates together (cf. Eogan 1969, 105). Decoration and construction of the lock-ring pair: Both lock-rings are constructed and decorated in a similar fashion. In terms of construction, the edging was made using c-sectioned binding. As Eogan (1969, 106) has noted, this is characteristic of lock-rings in Ireland and (sometimes) northern England but is not well represented in the south of England or in western France. Wood appears to be present in the core of lock-ring ?A? and requires additional, expert examination. La Niece and Cartwright (2009, 309), were able to identify a core of charred wood (Salix sp., willow) in the hollow centre of a lock-ring from Whalley, Lancashire (BM BEP registration no. 1966, 1208.1), with wax found in the core of an other lock-ring, from near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland (Ibid., 208). There is considerable potential for further/future analysis of the core material. In terms of decoration, both of the ?Shropshire Marches? lock-rings have incised, grooved decoration in the form of fine concentric circles of their visible face-plates. The lines (or grooves) are packed tightly and uniformly and present a neat and crisp decorative effect that beguiles the eye and poses the question of how the effect was achieved without the use of modern high-precision equipment. In some cases this decorative effect is achieved using skilled wirework rather than through the use of a ?tracer? (Eogan 1969, 104; Niece & Cartwright 2009, 309-12; Cahill 2009). Further examination of how the decorative technique and effect was achieved is required in the case of the ?Shropshire Marches? lock-rings. Some of the same decorative effects (concentric circular lines) are evident on the ?Shropshire bulla?, and the dating and metal composition of both finds suggests close technological, cultural and chronological connections between the two finds. Dimensions: The lead parcel has dimensions of 125mm by 78mm (min) / 92mm (max). It has a maximum thickness (as a parcel) of 22mm. The lead sheet itself is around 5-7mm thick. The total weight of the ?parcel?, including the two lock-rings and residual soil that the lead encloses is 698.4g.Lock-ring ?A?: Diameter: 46mm; Diameter of central opening: 13mm; Width of plate (visible face): 17mm. It is not possible to provide a weight for this lock-ring due to its present condition.Lock-ring ?B?:Measurements are difficult to obtain, x-ray analysis suggests it was similar in form to Lock-ring ?A? and this is supported by the one possible measurement ? of the width of the plate, which is also of 17mm. It is not possible to provide other dimensions for this lock-ring due to its present condition.Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis undertaken by the British Museum indicated that lock-rings A and B had similar surface compositions of approximately 80-82% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being copper. The lead sheet was also analysed using surface XRF and confirmed as being of reasonably pure lead (tin was not found to be present above the detection limit of the technique, i.e. less than c. 0.2% in this case).Discussion:Lock-rings are known in relatively small numbers from Ireland, Britain and western France (Eogan 1969). Most of the finest examples have been found in Ireland. Although damage inflicted during prehistory makes the full examination and appreciation of the ?Shropshire Marches? lock-rings impossible, they are very fine examples of their kind (cf. Eogan 1969). The lead sheet wrapping may have been made from an oval-shaped ?ingot? either for use as such a wrapping or as an ingot for trade and exchange. Our knowledge of how lead was transported and exchanged during the Late Bronze Age in England is extremely limited. Writing in 1988, Needham & Hook noted that the ?general dearth of metallic lead in British Bronze Age contexts is surprising as there can be little doubt that by the Late Bronze Age?lead and lead-based alloys were readily available? (1988, 259). Indeed, lead was heavily used as an alloying metal for the large amount of metalwork deposited in this period, and yet lead is rarely seen in its pure or near pure state, especially when compared to the amount of copper alloy raw material deposited. At the time of writing Needham and Hook were only able to identify 20 examples of tin/lead finds from Britain, and of these 20 only 10 were pure (or near pure) lead, the rest being tin/lead alloys. The largest of these are cast into objects: socketed axes and pommels (Ibid., app. 1). To the author?s knowledge there is no record of an oval-shaped relatively thin object having been discovered in a Late Bronze Age hoard. It is perhaps notable that the oval shape of the piece is comparable to copper and tin ingots of a similar period and the wrapping could represent a rare example of a Bronze Age lead ingot. The purpose of the lead wrapping is open to discussion and debate. It may have been designed to conceal the lock-rings (if so it damaged them beyond repair in the process) or to help ?sink? the light lock-rings when they were deposited in what appears to have been a wet and watery location. The lead itself may also be considered a significant ?sacrifice?, a point perhaps underlined by the relative rarity of ?pure? lead in the archaeological record for the Late Bronze Age. In order to more fully understand the motivations for deposition, more work is required on the immediate context of the find using palaeo-environmental techniques at the findspot, a process that is gladly underway thanks to the co-operation of the finder and landowner, and which should yield results in the near future. The other finds in close proximity to the lead parcel should also be considered when discussing the significance and wider implication of the find. The finder of the parcel has discovered at least one other notable lead object in the vicinity and, although it does not qualify as Treasure and is un-diagnostic of any particular period, could be the subject of future study using lead-isotope analysis as part of a wider project in order to address a number of questions surrounding trade/exchange and provenance of lead during this period (cf. Needham & Hook 1988). Taken together with the Shropshire bulla (Treasure case 2018 T343), which was found close-by, there appears to have been a relatively close connection between this region of Shropshire and Ireland during the later Bronze Age (cf. Hook & Needham 1989). The degree to which this was a direct connection, and the nature of the relationship remains to be established in the course of future research (in prep). Finally, the finds, the two gold lock-rings and lead sheet are now fused together. It represents a ?moment in time? when a Bronze Age person or group decided to create a parcel, very likely with the clear intention of deposition with limited prospect of recovery (given the wet/water context into which it was placed). This act or ?moment? is an important element of the objects cultural and archaeological significance. Conclusion:As a group of two objects that comprise of precious (in considerable excess of 10% of their weight) wrapped in a sheet of lead, this find constitutes Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).

Hole diameter: 6.5mm, Gap diameter: 2.4mmDiscussion: This penannular ring is a class of artefact which have in the past been given various terms such as &#39;hair-rings&#39; (Eogan 1997) and other monikers such as &lsquo;Ring Money&rsquo; (Geen 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65; Varndell 2001). Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003 opinion cited, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.They are given a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800 cal BC based on burials in Belgium, northeast France and the Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing Raftery 2004, 87-8) that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800 cal BC).Many penannular rings are composite with copper alloy cores but there is no evidence visually that that this is the case with this example. Instead banded rings such as this example have been suggested to have been inlaid with electrum which is then fused into the surface (Cahill 2009, 95).There are multiple examples of these type of rings on the PAS database including banded examples such as DOR-18E227, NLM-59A99B and LIN-A0EDEA. Banded examples from Hampshire include HAMP-0F9AF6, BERK-59F648 and SUR-7A1338Conclusion: Due to the material (gold) and accepted date (Bronze age) for these objects, it dates before 1720 and as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-09-01T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Hampshire,"Basingstoke and Deane","Restricted access",Baughurst,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",finder,1121341,images/edwardcaswelloxon/,OXON5CECC4.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,OXON,2018-10-16T12:43:08Z,2023-11-29T11:20:46Z

The ingot has been cast and then forged or hammered on two sides. The porosity seen in section at one end is created by the casting and then the ingot has been hit once it was cooled and this end section has cracked away. The opposite end has been sheared off with a blunt 'cold' chisel which has caused the end to expand slightly. So this piece may have come from a longer strip which was used and this fragment kept for future use or left to be melted down in a crucible.From the analysis below, Professor Peter Northover has concluded that the gold fragment dates from the Late Bronze Age, as the ratio of the different elements goes with the typology. If the ingot had been produced during the Middle Bronze Age the copper content would have been lower, and if it had been made during the Iron Age there would have been more silver and less copper. The composition of the gold also shows that it is natural gold alloyed with leaded bronze and, just possibly, some copper (Peter Northover pers comm).A similar plano-convex ingot was discovered within a hoard of gold bracelets from Llanarmon-yn-ial, Denbighshire which date from the Late Bronze Age (NGMW accession number: 82.93H/1-5/ Green 1982).References:Green, H.S., 1982, 'A late Bronze Age hoard from Llanarmon-yn-ial', Archaeology in Clwyd 5, p.15.Varndell, G. 2000: A Late Bronze Age Gold Ingot from Liddington, Wiltshire in Treasure Annual Report 1998-1999, DCMS, London p.14, no.11Richardson, A. and Varndell, G.

The raised edges are created when the sides are hammered to keep the them parallel and control the shape before forming the ingot into an armlet or band or ribbon ornament. Both ends are flattened and flanged and have been sheared off with a blunt 'cold' chisel which has caused the ends to expand. So this piece may have come from a longer strip which was used and this fragment kept for future use. A bracelet fragment with similar raised sides has been recorded in NMGW-E48854 and another band of similar width as part of another bracelet in IOW-8BBE91, which are both dated from the Late Bronze Age.From the analysis below, Professor Peter Northover has concluded that the gold fragment dates from the Late Bronze Age, as the ratio of the different elements goes with the typology. If the gold had been produced during the Middle Bronze Age the copper content would have been lower, and if it had been Iron Age in date the composition would have had more silver and less copper. The composition of the gold also shows that it is natural gold alloyed with leaded bronze and, just possibly, some copper (Peter Northover pers comm).Savory (1980) illustrates several gold armlets with hammered raised edges from the Capel Isaf hoard found in Wales, on pp.126 & 195, fig.47, nos.1-4.There is also a similar ingot with sheared off ends from a hoard (2004 T416) found near Cirencester, Gloucestershire illustrated in the Treasure Annual Report 2004, on pp.26 & 233, fig.17.5, no.17, which is dated from c.1300-1100 BC.",,,"Analysed by Professor Gregor Borg using an XRF spectrometer at the Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany as part of the Cornish gold project in association with the analyses of the Nebra Sky Disc.77.09-77.68 % gold15.66-16.2 % silver5.69-6.22 % copper0.3-0.47% tin0.15-0.18% lead0.17 % iron",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-06-21T23:00:00Z,2018-06-21T23:00:00Z,"South West",Cornwall,Cornwall,"Restricted access","St. Buryan",,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (from the finder)","Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,1024214,images/atyacke/,DSCN6597.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,CORN,2018-08-08T13:29:13Z,2019-10-21T10:43:24Z

However, few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating (Meeks et al. 2008, 13). Gwilt (2015) suggests (citing&nbsp;Raftery 2004, 87-8)&nbsp;that, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing such that these items may be placed within the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).Dr Edward CaswellFinds Liaison for Oxfordshire16th February 2022Bibliography:Armbruster, B.R. 2021.

The reverse is plain although traces of the upper design&rsquo;s creation are faintly visible.The object is a bright gold colour.Dimensions: In its current state the bracelet is 17.5mm long, 11.2mm wide, the sheet being 9.3mm wide, 3.3mm thick in profile, the sheet being 0.6mm thick and weighs 1.30 grams.Discussion: &nbsp;Similar gold strips with incised decoration have been found as isolated objects in Hampshire (2019 T866 Hinds 2019, Adams 2019 2019T 513), Shropshire (2017 T42 Oakden 2017), Yorkshire (2019 T274 Griffiths 2019), Staffordshire (2016 T1039 Gilmore 2016), and Warwickshire (2007 T672 Bolton 2007).One has also been found in a hoard on the database from Cornwall (2020 T222 Tyacke 2020) which has been dated to the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 cal BC following Roberts et al. 2013)Similar narrow embossed strips are also illustrated by Taylor (1980, fig 28a-f) which are suggested to the Early Bronze Age.Further multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) while an in context example has been found from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980) in a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium&nbsp;BC.As such there are a number of parallels spread from across the country that would support this is&nbsp; Bronze age in date, these tend to be suggested to be Early bronze Age but the Penard dated hoard cited above suggests it may also date later into the Bronze Age.",,,"The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. However, almost all of the original patina has been lost through laminating corrosion.  The axe is a mid green colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present.

It is a penannular loop with flared, expanding terminals. These are close together, leaving a gap of only about 4-6mm between them. Each terminal is circular and the ends are concave or hollow. The inner face of one terminal is rough and corroded and has gravel adhering to the concretion. The outer sides of the terminals are straight, flaring from the armlet hoop to the widest point of the terminals at the very end. The hoop is mainly D shaped in cross section and varies in diameter. It is c.12mm diameter immediately behind the terminals, swelling to c.18mm diameter at the side of the hoop opposite the terminals. The overall plan is D-shaped, the terminals being in the middle of the straight edge. It has been suggested that the original shape of the bracelet has been changed, as the terminals are unusually close to each other. There are some short shallow grooves on the inside of the hoop, near one of the terminals, and parallel to the end of the terminal. These are worn and patinated. The surface is mainly smooth and worn, with a few small pits, and has a turquoise green patina, with some areas of golden olive green. The armlet is 113.4mm long, 88.8mm wide (from terminals to the outer side of the hoop) and 24mm thick across the terminals. The internal measurements are 83.2mm long and 48.6mm wide from the terminal to the inner edge of the apex. 362g. The artefact was recovered from a quarry and has been through a washing plant where it would have been scrubbed with sand. This may account for the smooth, worn surface, but the fact that not all the patina has been removed suggests that it was a well developed patina originally. The small areas of olive green colouration may indicate the original colour.This object could also be a Post Medieval to Modern West African manilla or currency bar such as WMID-22DE66, LANCUM-41B6C5 or LIN-E37002, but all of these previously recorded on the PAS database have solid, teardrop shaped terminals, and a more open, horseshoe like shape in plan. However, it remains a possibility that this is a manilla of different style. The depth and uniformity of the patina argues against this interpretation.A good parallel but in gold rather than copper alloy is HAMP-5E48D1. Photographs of the copper alloy armlet were sent to several specialists. Adam Gwilt (National Museum of Wales) suggested that there is a tendancy for bronze versions of objects that are usually gold to be more common in Western and Northern Britain and provided a reference that touches on this: Gwilt et al (2005) A Late Bronze Age Hoard from Trevalyn Farm, Rossett, Wrexham, with Some Obvervations on Hoarding Practice and Gold Bracelet Weights"" in Studia Celtica XXXIX (2005), pages 27 - 61. He also noted that the squashed oval form looked atypical and suggested that the terminals may have been pushed inwards, perhaps deliberately before deposition. He suggested that the shape of the terminals are possible for the Late Bronze Age, though this example has chunky proportions.Julia Farley (British Museum) agreed that the patina was plausibly Bronze Age or Iron Age, and Neil Wilkin (British Museum) was also prepared to entertain a Late Bronze Age date, citing a pair of slightly more slender copper alloy pennannular bracelets with expanded terminals recovered in a cache of Late Bronze Age (Ewart Park / Carp's Tongue) metalwork at Minster in Thanet, Kent which were excavated in 2010 - 2011 (MOLA Excavation Report: 'Prehistoric and Roman settlement at Tothill Street, Minster in Thanet, Kent' downloaded from www.kentarchaeology.org.uk). He did point out that the terminals are closer together than the Thanet examples, and the shape is more kidney-shaped.In conclusion, this object is likely to be a Late Bronze Age armlet that has been distorted, perhaps deliberately, and one that has been made in copper alloy rather than the more usual gold.",1,"County / local importance",,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-05-21T23:00:00Z,2018-05-21T23:00:00Z,"Yorkshire and the Humber","North Yorkshire",Harrogate,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder",,1017687,images/acooper/,3171_Armlet_1.jpg,"Restricted info","Other chance find",,SWYOR,2018-06-21T10:23:36Z,2019-02-28T16:21:06Z

Coroner2018 T343: A Late Bronze Age Gold 'Bulla' from the 'Shropshire Marches'HM Coroner: Mr. John ElleryDistrict: ShropshireDate: Late Bronze Age, (c.1000-750 BC)Findspot: To be known as 'Shropshire Marches I'Date of discovery: 12th May 2018Circumstances of discovery: Whilst searching with a metal detector.Description:Form and construction: This object is called a 'bulla' (an antiquarian term derived from the Latin for bubble), a large, hollow pendant of sheet gold which would have been suspended and most probably worn for adornment (Taylor 1980, 64-6; Eogan 1994, 89; Murgia et al. 2014).In shape the bulla is broadly a 'D' shaped crescent in plan and a trapezoidal wedge shape in profile. In overall form it could be described as keel shaped. The pendant is a composite being formed of at least two piece of gold sheet. On either side of the upper edge (at the widest part) are collars formed from gold sheet and filled with organic compacted soil. These flank a 'false' tube that acts as a long loop from which the pendant could have been suspended. The top of the bulla curves evenly along its length forming an even subtly elegant shape. A sheet of gold plate is rolled and fixed at its mid-point; it projects from either edge and descends to form the front and rear plates of the body of the pendant. If straightened the body plate would be broadly rectangular with a waisted mid-point and rounded C shaped external edges. The plate fits seamlessly with the tube collars and the fixing points are concealed. The external edges are slightly beaded. A base plate most probably a pointed oval shape closes the two sides. Again the joints are concealed and fixing points seamless within the construct. The space constructed by these sheets is box like with a hollow void contained within the pendant. It is likely that the separate components of the bulla were soldered together. When solder is used on Bronze Age objects, the composition of the gold is likely to be richer in copper and/or silver than the components being soldered together. It was not possible to identify the presence of solder categorically (from the compositional analysis undertaken using XRF-analysis). However, the use of soldering is well demonstrated among objects from Middle and Late Bronze Age Britain (La Niece pers comm.; La Niece et al. 2015; La Nice et al. 2009; cf. Armbruster et al. 2014), and its use is very probable in the case of the 'Shropshire Marches' bulla.Decoration:The bulla has been highly decorated with engraved stylised geometric designs; every surface is covered with intricate and highly precise evenly proportioned patterns. These designs must have been marked out using compass or dividers and has been hand cut using a very fine graver with a 45 degree wedged cutting edge. The design is such that the decoration adds an additional texture which brings out the best reflective nature of the gold and makes the decorative design seem to be constantly moving with the play of light and reflection. The decoration is applied almost entirely through cutting or engraving - there seems to be no punched or repousse style patterns. This suggests that the gold plate from which the pendant is decorated is relatively thick and that the decoration is applied after construction of the form. The design can be broken into several zones:The 'front' face - which is broadly D shaped in plan - is decorated with an external C shaped border which respects and takes it form from the external edge. This border is filled with ten evenly spaced grooves or channels which are evenly cut and are continuous around the edge. Within this area the space is divided unevenly by a slightly curved horizontal decorative band below which is a D shaped panel. The decorative band is delimitated by a pair of horizontal parallel engraved lines (similar to the border) each with five evenly spaced grooves. Within the area created by the paired bands are a series of tessellating broadly equilateral opposing triangles. Each triangle is filled with diagonal cut lines; the upper row are all cut with lines running top right to bottom left, whereas the lower are decorated top left to lower right. The only triangle which differs is that on the right hand edge where the lines are cut horizontally. In the area below this band - on the body of the pendant - the space is filled with further geometric panels - at the centre is a square shaped panel filled by a saltire / diagonal cross with the upper and lower triangular wedges decorated with lines engraved top right - bottom left; where-as, the triangles to the left and right are engraved with opposing lines. Flanking this central square on either side are right-angled triangles engraved with vertical lines and the rest of the area - to left and right is engraved with diagonal lines set in plane with the angle of the triangle. From careful viewing of the engraving under magnification it is clear that the external border was cut first and the internal decoration applied later during construction - this is because in several the engraving lines cut through and therefore overlay the border. The overall decorative effect can be described as 'solar' in character, a feature of other Bronze Age goldwork, especially from Early Bronze Age Ireland (Cahill 2015). An illustration of the now lost Irwell bulla shows that it's 'front' face was similarly decorated.The 'back' plate is similarly decorated with a broad external border. However, the pattern within this differs to that previously described. Here the panel is decorated by three concentric semi-circular bands each of five grooves which emanate from a horizontal band of grooves aligned on the tube. Each of these concentric D shaped panels is decorated with geometric designs: in the smallest inner panel another much smaller saltire cross is present again decorated with opposing engraved lines as described above. Flanking this square are two sub-triangular panels filled with vertical incised lines. The two descending concentric panels are again entirely filled and decorated with tessellating opposed triangles as described before.The decision to term the faces 'front' and 'back' is subjective, based on the greater complexity of the decoration on the 'front' when compared to the 'back'. However, an important point to stress is that the bulla was an example of reversible fashion: one face could be selected depending on the event, time or year or wearer. This is also true of several other bullae (see Cahill 2018), including the Irwell Canal example.The area overlying the suspension tube is decorated differently. Here the space has been divided into two pairs of horizontal panels; each pair is separated by a spine of horizontal lines and is flanked by similar lines. The horizontal panels are again filled with opposing diagonal lines which fill the entire length of the panel in a feather like pattern. Again this decoration has been applied after the external borders as in places it overlaps the external border.The final area of decoration is along the lower wedge shaped edge. Here the design is simpler with two flanking bands each of ten horizontal grooves with the middle panel being filled with very fine vertically cut lines. The fineness of these lines is astounding and unlike in other areas these do not cut through the border. The alternating directions in which the decoration has been engraved serves to define the edges of the decorative motifs and to enhance the effects of the play of light on all the bulla's surfaces.Contents of the bulla:Some Irish bullae have been shown to have cores of baked clay and one had a core of lead (Cahill 2018). CT scanning of the bulla by the Scientific Department at the British Museum has shown that the bulla does not contain anything as dense as metal. It is more likely that it contained baked clay - or that it was empty at the time of deposition and has since filled with soil from the findspot. Loose material from the perforations of the bulla was analysed by the British Museum (using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Pyrolysis gas chromatography - mass spectrometry) and was able to rule out the presence of beeswax and to identify quartz/silica consistent with soil/clay. Another substance was detected but at the time of writing requires further study before its identity can be fully resolved.Condition:The bulla is formed of gold sheet and is unpatinated and in a clean state. The external edges have small areas of abrasion commensurate with movement in the soil. The front and rear faces have also been slightly crushed / depressed although the overall form is integrally sound. None of this distortion effects the overall decorative scheme although some abrasion cuts through the design.Dimensions:Width: 47.4mm; Height: 36.7mm; Thickness across base: 13.0mm; Thickness across upper edge: 6.8mm; External diameter of tube: 7.7mm Internal diameter of tube: 4.8mm; thickness of rolled rim; 1.8mm: Thickness of plate: 0.7mm.Weight: 26.6 grams.Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken by the Department of Scientific Research, indicated a surface composition of approximately 79-81% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being copper. Results of surface X-ray fluorescence analysis are qualitative as only the surface (and not the core) of the object was examined.Discussion: This suggests very good agreement for all parts of the object. The values do not rule out a Late Bronze Age date and are consistent with other goldwork from this period.This is only the eighth bulla discovered to date in Britain and Ireland (cf. Cahill 2018, for an overview of previous discoveries). It is only the second to have been found in England, the other seven being from Ireland, primarily from the north part of the island (Cahill 2018: 18). The other English example, found in the Irwell ship canal (Manchester, Lancashire) during the 18th-century in the course of dredging. In terms of form, the 'Shropshire Marches' bulla is best paralleled by the Irwell find. The workmanship of the construction and decoration of the 'Shropshire Marches' bulla represents the highest skill and expertise seen within decorated metalwork of the period being almost un-paralleled within a British context.Details of the Irwell bulla are known from an antiquarian source from the later 18th century. This reports that in May 1772 a gold 'Roman Bulla' (Whitaker 1773: Book I, 79-81 & Fishwick 1894), was found whilst deepening the river channel close to the second lock of the River Irwell, Manchester (Lancashire). However, a different antiquarian source indicates that the Irwell find was made in 1758 (Timperley 1839: 48). It was possibly discovered in association with a sword or a Celt (axe) both of which were displayed in the Leverium Museum the contents of which were dispersed through sale in June 1806 (Donovan 1806: 202). The Irwell bulla was sold for 2 4S 4d (according to hand written notes in the volume in Biodiversity Heritage Library digitised by the Smithsonian, Washington), and has since been lost from the record. Phelps (1915) (correctly) identified the Irwell bulla as an object of Bronze Age date and indicated a potential connection with Ireland where bullae were known.The Irish bullae are more 'heart-shaped' than the two English finds, with their more crescentic shape. The Irish corpus includes bulla formed around baked clay or lead cores over which a thick sometimes decorated gold foil has been applied; others have hollow cores, similar to the Shropshire find (Cahill 2018, 20, 23, fig. 4). The decoration on the Shropshire bulla is best paralleled with the gold foil covered lead bulla from the Bog of Allen, Co. Kildare. This example has a decorated lead core over which thin gold foil has been applied. The decoration is broadly similar with similar decorative motifs: interlocking triangles with fills applied in opposite directions in order to define the edges of the design.The skills deployed in the construction and decoration represents the highest skill and expertise seen within decorated metalwork of the period being almost un-paralleled within a British context, although elements are known from other categories of goldwork, most notably lock-rings (Eogan 1969). Lock-rings are known from Britain, Ireland and North-West France (Eogan 1994, fig. 41), and date to the period c.1000 - 750 BC.A small number of them are decorated, and a subset of these are decorated with interlocking chevrons similar to the 'Shropshire Marches' bulla, including the recent find from Hambledon, Hampshire (Treasure case 2017 T349). The function of bullae is uncertain; they have been interpreted as reliquaries or charms (Taylor 1980, 66), but it has not been possible to link this suggestion to the analysis of their contents.The nature and environment of the findspot of the bulla is the subject of on-going research.The wider context of the discovery is also of note. The bulla forms the most south-westerly example of high quality Bronze Age goldwork production and deposition (from Early, Middle and Late periods, c.2000/1900 - 800 BC). The significance and context of the bulla relates to this tradition of goldworking excellence (or desire to obtain objects of the highest quality), and to the presence of rich mineral deposits (including copper, gold and lead) in this region of Britain. The find reflects important connections between England, Wales and Ireland during the latest phase of the Bronze Age.Conclusion:As an object made of more than 10% of precious metal, and being more than 300 years old, the 'Shropshire Marches' bulla qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).References:Armbruster, B.

Sub-triangular in plan, lenticular in section and in profile. At 101 mm in length the axe is slightly over half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age axe from South-west England. It is 43.5 mm wide at the blade end, tapering to 20 mm near the damaged butt end; its maximum thickness is 9.5 mm and its weight 164.45 g. The sides are straight and do not flare outwards to meet the blade edge which is slightly curved in plan. Much of the original surface has been lost and the axe is pitted and abraded through corrosion and movement within the plough soil. One face is less corroded but there is no evidence of any form of incised decoration on the surface of the axe. The butt end has broken in antiquity to create a central projection which has subsequently worn to a smooth point. The break suggests that part of the axehead was left in the haft or handle which means that it was used.Pearce (1983) describes a miniature Migdale (Sutherland, Scotland) type flat axe, with a slightly flared blade, from Banner Down, Somerset on page 502, which is illustrated in pl.69, no.587 and a wider, broader Migdale type flat axe with straight sides from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall on page 418, pl.12, no.98c, which are both associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Schmidt & Burgess (1981) discuss Migdale flat axes on pp.35-45 and the Biggar variants, with their straighter sides and less rounded cutting edges, on pp.46-48. These are illustrated in plates 5 to 19. A similar small flat axe with straight sides and a shallow curve to the blade, of the Biggar variant type, from Yorkshire, which is the same length, is illustrated in pl.19, no.241.There are similar miniature Migdale type axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, p.122) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South West",Cornwall,Cornwall,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (from the finder)","Returned to finder",,1012115,images/atyacke/,DSCN0205.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,CORN,2018-04-27T14:19:55Z,2018-05-09T00:33:49Z

Internally the socket is wedge shaped - it tapers and narrows to the cutting edge. Externally the sides of the axehead are broadly parallel before expanding to form a crescentic shaped blade with distinct blade tips. On the upper part of the socket is a D-shaped, ovate sectioned attachment loop it is positioned directly below the swollen collar. Casting flashes are present on both sides of the axehead including the loop and a crack is present along one corner. The flashes have been trimmed and hammered flat. Likewise the blade is prepared and sharpened - suggesting the axe was in a condition where it would have been usable.Three distinct vertical ribs are present on the two widest surfaces of the axehead, these commence from the underside of the moulded collar and taper to blunt points on the lower blade before the cutting facet of the axe.The metal has a largely shiny reddish/brown patina with some green patches on the blade.

The long outer edges of the sheet are also slightly expanded. This has been tightly rolled down its length over 450 degrees. One terminal is at the centre of the spiral so that it is not possible to determine if it was broken or represents the original end however it clearly ends with a clean transverse edge. The opposite terminal ends in an irregular and bent transverse break. A slightly rattling and the lack of light travelling through the spiral suggests fragments of the artefact are held within the spiral.The object is a bright gold colour. There are numerous scratches and dents on its outer surface and no signs of decoration beyond the expanded edges.Dimensions: In its current state the bracelet is 27.2mm long, representing its original width, 13.6mm wide and c.10.4mm thick in profile. The strips original maximum thickness can be estimated at 2.2mm and it weighs 9.27 grams.Discussion:The object is incomplete and folded such that its original form can only be inferred. Similarly formed gold strips with expanded borders have been called rings, as at Binestead, West Sussex (Varndell 1998-9: 10-11) which has previously been declared treasure. Other similarly sized examples have also been termed flange twisted bracelets as at Maesmelan, Powys (Green et al 1983) and Capel Isaf (Savory 1980: No.302). Both these and further bracelets with expanded borders are illustrated by Armbruster (2021: Figures 95 and 186) and are considered to date to the Ornament horizon (sensu Smith 1959) which is dated to between c. 1400-1100 cal BC (Roberts 2008, Wilkin 2017).&nbsp;This object has been found in the same field as another potentially Bronze Age gold bracelet (2018 T229) found over 400m away, which would support the suggestion that this is the result of Bronze Age activity in the area.Conclusion: The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

Description: Possibly less than half of the object survives due to two transverse breaks in the bar. The object is made of a rod that has bent into a U-shape in plane. This rod is square in section with accentuated corners created by slightly concave edges. This has been twisted tightly across surviving its length, having 22 twists. Scientific Analysis carried out by the British Museum?s Department of Scientific Research using Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis. This indicated a surface composition of approximately 79-81% gold and 17-19% silver, the rest being copper. Dimensions: The ring has a relatively even thickness across its surviving length ranging between 2.4mm thick and 2.6mm thick. In plan it is now 27.2mm long, 15.5mm wide and weighs 2.29 grams.Discussion: Similar examples to this piece are illustrated by Eogan (1994: pl.4) and Taylor (1980: pl.41) who term these Gold ?bar? and ?flanged twisted? torcs. These have been dated typologically to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Eogan 1994: 69, 74, 91; Roberts 2007: 141) albeit with the suggestion they may overlap into the preceding Taunton phase (ibid), when twisting and flange twisting bars and ribbons of gold were common techniques in Britain (Taylor 1980: 60) and in Europe (Armbruster 2021: 156-8). Torcs of this style are most common in southern England and East Anglia, but do occur elsewhere in Wales and central Britain (Roberts 2007: fig.4).

The ring is composed of two bands of gold, stacked one on top of the other, and apparently soldered together. Each band is sub-circular (oval) in cross-section and the ring is sub-circular (oval) when viewed in plan. The terminals are flat and do not meet. There is no further decoration.Dimensions: The ring is 16.2mm long, 14.6mm wide and 7.2mm thick. The gap between the terminals is 3.7mm. It weighs 10.73g. Each of the two individual bands are of equal dimensions.Discussion: Penannular rings are a relatively common class of artefact reported through the Treasure Act with many known examples including NMGW-04216C. The report for which states: &quot;The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O&#39;Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange.Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing. Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC)&quot;. (Gwilt 2015).Many penannular rings of his type are composite with copper alloy cores but there is no evidence visually that that this is the case with this example. Further examples of two gold or gold-plated penannular rings, stacked one on top of the other, can be found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: DENO-A13440, IOW-1F5D46 and HAMP-471843.Conclusion: The ring appears to be over 10% precious metal and more than 300 years old and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Andrew Williams Portable Antiquities Scheme InternFebruary 2018",1,,"The object contains a minimum of 10% of precious metal and is over 300 years old.

The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a narrow butt evenly expanding sides that extend to a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile the axe is broadly lentoid / lenticular, with tapering ends. In cross section the axe is rectangular shaped with both sides being relatively flat and sides having a rounded curve.

The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is present - this is uneven in form being shallower on one face than the other. The axe is a mid-green colour with a large areas of highly polished surface patina. This patina has been broken in several places and where this has occurred laminating corrosion has removed considerable surfaces. Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident of the blade of the axe, however, a series of large scars are present on both faces. Both faces also suffer from both large and small corrosion pitting. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. Although there has been some surface loss there is no evidence of applied incised or hammered decoration. This axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the undecorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. It is very similar to Needham's flat axe class 3 having a medium sized butt, lenticular profile, no stop and no side flanges (i.e. flat). Ascribing it to a sub-type is more difficult although it shares some attributes of Needham's Class 3D Type Barton Stacey described as having narrow thin butt, lenticular profile, moderate haft end expansion, sides with gentle curvature, and broad mid-blade and cutting edge. This form of axe is known in the Welsh Marches and a matrix mould from Walleybrook, Shropshire was used to cast this type.

The sheet slightly downturns at one of these breaks and upturns at the other.The outer surface of the sheet has decoration consisting of 3 parallel grooves that run the length of the object taking up its entire width. This creates a design of four distinct ridges &nbsp;The reverse is plain.The object is a bright gold colour and has scratches on both surfaces. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the fragment&nbsp; indicated a surface composition of approximately 76-78% gold, 21-23% silver, the rest being copper.Dimensions: It is 11.1mm long, 10.2mm wide, 1.5mm thick and weighs 1.26 gramsDiscussion: There are numerous similar gold strips found&nbsp; as isolated objects recorded on the database including examples from Cambridgeshire (2018 T876, Bliss 2018), Essex (2020 T118, Flynn 2020), Kent (2020 T327, Rogerson 2020), Wiltshire (2021 T454, Adams 2021). These are all intereprted to be Bronze Age in date.A particularly similar example is illustrated by Eogan (1994: fig. 21) from a hoard at Mountfield battle (Franks 1864) which is dated to the Ornament Horizon (sensu Smith 1959) placed between 1400-1100 cal BC (Roberts 2007, Wilkin 2017). Similar narrow embossed strips are also illustrated by Taylor (1980, fig 28a-f) which are suggested to the Early Bronze Age.Further multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2)As such there are a number of parallels spread from across the country that would support this is Bronze age in date.Conclusion:&nbsp; The object is a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Dr Edward CaswellFinds Liaison for Oxfordshire16th February 2022Bibliography:Adams, K (2021)&nbsp;GLO-8372F2: A BRONZE AGE RIBBON&nbsp;Web page available at:&nbsp;https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1031966&nbsp;[Accessed: 24 Feb 2022 11:45:46]Bliss, A (2018)&nbsp;SF-AC2907: A BRONZE AGE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT&nbsp;Web page available at:&nbsp;https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/926051&nbsp;[Accessed: 24 Feb 2022 11:44:01]DCMS 2003 Treasure Annual Report 2003DCMS 2003 Portable Antiquties And Treasure Annual Report 2007Eogan, G.

Faceted AxeheadA near complete cast bronze copper alloy faceted socketed axe (axehead) The axe is elegantly cast being relatively slender and well-proportioned with a trumpet shaped collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade. The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section with the two casters / runners being removed. The shape of the mouth is sub-rectangular (rectangular with rounded corners). The trumpet-shaped mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the wide collar. The collar is defined by two D shaped circumferential beads forming a transverse encircling panel that is slightly recessed. The loop is D-shaped in cross section. The upper body of the axe below the collar is faceted, with six faces. The lower section of the axe flares to form an elegantly expanding blade. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been trimmed but have not been hammered flat or filed. The cutting edge is crescentic; however, it has been chipped and broken due to movement in the ploughsoil. There is no evidence of cast nor applied ornament on the axe. The axe is a corroded mid green colour with an uneven surface patina that is partially caked in compacted soil. The socket of the axe is also choked with soil.Dimensions: The axe measures length; 96.8mm, the blade is 43.4mm wide, The socket at the mouth is 32.8mm at socket and 30.6mm thick. The socket depth is unknown. The internal dimensions of the mouth of the socket are 23.7mm x 20.mm. The side wall is 6.5 mm thick. The loop is 22.0mm long, 8.0mm wide and 2.9mm thick, it projects 7.3mm from the body of the axe. The axe weighs: 104.64 grams3.                     Faceted AxeheadA near complete cast bronze copper alloy faceted socketed axe (axehead) The axe is elegantly cast being relatively slender and well-proportioned with a trumpet shaped collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade. The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section with the two casters / runners being removed. The shape of the mouth is oval. The trumpet-shaped mouth of the axe tapers and the side loop is relatively small in a low position set beneath the wide collar. The collar is defined by being smooth whist the area beneath is faceted. The loop is D-shaped in cross section. The upper body of the axe below the collar is faceted, with six faces. The lower section of the axe flares to form an elegantly expanding blade. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been trimmed and hammered flat preparing the axe for use. The cutting edge is crescentic; however, it has been chipped and broken due to movement in the ploughsoil. There is no evidence of cast nor applied ornament on the axe. The axe is a corroded mid green colour with an uneven surface patina that is partially caked in compacted soil. The socket of the axe is also choked with soil.Dimensions: The axe measures length; 97.1mm, the blade is 40.7mm wide, The socket at the mouth is 33.8mm wide and 30.6mm thick. The socket depth is unknown. The internal dimensions of the mouth of the socket are 17.0mm x 14.3mm. The side wall is 5.8 mm thick. The loop is 10.2mm long, 5.4mm wide and 3.5mm thick, it projects 7.3mm from the body of the axe. The axe weighs: 201 grams4.         Side Looped SpearheadAn incomplete and broken cast copper alloy/ bronze side looped and socketed spear (spearhead). Both the spear tip and also the base of the socket have been lost. Originally the spearhead would have been broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile. The hollow socket is near complete with small areas of relatively modern damage at the base. Two single cast ?string? side loops are present, one on either edge positioned approximately 2/3 along the length of the socket and are parallel with the blade. The cross section of the loops is lentoid. Both loops are filled to some extent with an orange corrosion product, probably an iron pan, due to the burial conditions. The tip of the blade is lost due to a recent un-patinated break. The break has occurred at the weakpoint across the tip of the conical socket which extends along the mid-rib into the blade section. The mid-rib is best described as having a lozenge section and would have continued to the tip of the blade. The long blade edges are lost and the blades themselves are heavily eroded. What remains of the blades have patinated longitudinal scratches on them where they have been sharpened for use. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear have trimmed, hammered flat and filed. The spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with an even but much corroded patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and a slightly pitted surface remains. The tip of the socket is choked with soil. Dimensions: The spearhead measures 70.4mm length, has an external diameter across base of socket of 15.0mm and an internal one of 12.4mm, the side walls are 1.8mm thick and the depth of the socket is 70.4mm. The blade is a maximum of 17.8mm wide and is 9.2mm thick at the same point. The side loops have a maximum length of 14.5mm, project 1.6mm from the side of the socket are 3.6mm wide and 1.8mm thick. The internal diameter of the loop measures 6.9mm x 1.7mm. The spearhead weighs 25.79 grams.5.         Socketed GougeA complete socketed gouge; in form the gouge is broadly cylindrical in shape with slightly tapering / converging sides terminating in a broken but re-sharpened / re-shaped flat cutting edge. The mouth of the socket is simple and has no mouldings around it. There is no evidence of a collar. The casting seams are hammered flat and filed / removed. The gouge groove begins at approximately 1/2 along the existing length of the tool (approximately 33mm below the socket). The blade edge is relatively flat, but the upper edges are curved. A distinct ground or sharpened facetted cutting edge is present. The gouge generally has good surface survival and has a black brown patina. Dimensions: The gouge measures 58.1mm length, it is 9.0mm wide at the cutting edge. The socket has an external width of 14.1mm and thickness of 12.0mm; the internal dimensions of the socket are 9.7mm length, 8.0mm width; the side walls have a maximum thickness of 2.4mm. It is highly likely that the socket is conical, and the upper part is choked with dried soil preventing a measurement of depth. The gouge weighs 33.58 grams6.         Tanged ChiselA near complete cast copper-alloy tanged chisel broken into two parts that almost conjoin. The chisel has been rolled within the ploughsoil and both the tip of the tang and elements of the blade have been lost through recent breaks. The tang is broadly a tapering rectangular shape with a tapering square section. The lower break does not neatly conjoin with the square scar on the lower element. The tang is positioned within the middle of a flared collar which also acts as a stop. Beneath this the blade tapers and the flares to form a triangular cutting edge.  The lower edge of the collar is thickened, and a faceted band is present on the upper blade. The long edge of both the tang and blade have had their casting seams neatly trimmed and hammered flat. The cutting edge is lost but again seems to be finished and functionally used. The chisel is a corroded mid grey green colour with well-formed surface patina.Dimensions: The chisel measures 61.4mm length when both parts are combined. It has a weight of 30.27 gramsThe tang fragment measures: 21.0mm length, an is 3.7mm wide and 7.9mm thick at the break at the tip of the tang. At the base of the tang it measures 6.0mm wide and 7.3mm thick. The fragment weighs: 5.69 gramsThe blade fragment measures: 40.2mm length, the collar measures 9.1mm wide and 9.7mm thick tapering to 8.1mm wide and 7.4mm thick across the waisted upper blade. The cutting edge is unknown due to damage but the blade has a maximum width of 21. 1mm.The fragment weighs 24.58 grams. 7.            Possible Anvil FragmentAn irregular faceted fragment of cast copper alloy most probably the partial remains of an anvil. The fragment is broadly rectangular in plan and profile have an irregular, broadly faceted oval in cross section. The piece is highly patinated with a deep brown coloured polished surface patina ? the surface is rolled and abraded. Two areas with least damage is an oval boss on one face which is itself sub-divided by three raised faceted faces. To one end the fragment has more of a tapering rectangular form ? which might possibly be described as an angular beaked projection. There are also several oval hollows or recesses on the piece but there is no evidence of drilled holes or drawplates. It should also be noted that this cast object is amazingly dense / heavy for its size.Dimensions: 47.1mm length, 25.0mm width and is 27.3mm high; it weighs: 181 grams.8.         Bifid Tanged RazorAn incomplete fragmentary cast copper alloy / bronze bifid tanged razor; the external edges and part of the tang are lost due to erosion in the ploughsoil. The razor is at its thickest at the mid-point where four central raised cast ribs descend from a semi-circular perforation at the mid-point of the top edge. The decorative ribs splay slightly along their length terminating at the top of the rectangular shaped tang. The tang descends from the mid-point of the lower edge and the external edge is abraded. From the semi-circular hole on the upper edge two parallel sided blades extend ? forming a V shaped which originally would have had curved external edges. These have been lost and the edge is feathered and heavily abraded. The surface of the razor is poorly preserved with laminating corrosion being present. The surface is a mottled green colour. Dimensions: The razor measures 53.3mm length, is 32.4mm wide across the blade and 4.0mm thick across the central rib. The tang descends 12.2mm below the bottom of the blade, is 9.5mm wide and 2.0mm thick. The razor weighs: 9.20 grams9.                     Cauldron handle / ringA massive cast copper alloy cauldron ring / handle. In plan the ring is circular and in cross section the hoop has an irregular faceted near octagonal shape. The ring has been cast in one piece and the remains of a trimmed, hammered and filed casting seam is present on both the internal and external edges. All faceted edges bear patinated diagonal file marks. The internal edge of the ring has a distinct wear facet from where it has suspended most probably during use. The ring is a mid-brown green colour with a well formed surface patina which has been chipped and abraded in places by movement within the ploughsoil.Dimensions: The external diameter of the ring measures 100.9mm. The hoop of the ring has a maximum width of 14.7mm and thickness of 14.7mm this narrows across the wear facet to to 11.8mm wide and 13.6mm thick. It has an internal diameter of 76.5mm and it weighs: 334 grams. 10.                    Copper alloy fragment / probable spearhead fragmentThe fragment is irregular in plan and profile, it is most probably from a socketed spearhead as it comprises part of both the internal socked and expanding blade. It has a mid-green colour with a mineralised laminating patina. Dimensions: The fragment measures 35.6mm length, is 15.2mm wide across the blade and 8.0mm thick; it weighs: 7.57 grams.11. - 14.            Metalworking DebrisFour pieces of metalworking residue associated with metal casting. All were found in the same area as the above finds and are being treated as part of the hoard. They all have amorphous shapes and a similar mid green grey coloured surface patinaDimensions: Bulk Weight:140 gramsAdditional Artefacts:Two other artefacts were reported with the above material and have been recorded separately with the Portable Antiquities Scheme. They include:	A single cylindrical artefact of probable post medieval date (AD 1600-1800). 	A copper alloy ring set within a piece of concretePreviously Reported finds from the same siteAn HER record from October 1981 lists a late Bronze Age / Ewart Park Sword being recovered from the field in which this hoard was discovered. The sword was discovered in the late summer of 1976 after ploughing. The sword was subsequently reported to the British Museum and is included within the National Bronze Age Index. The sword is described as being damaged an twisted within the record and this is consistent with other material from Bronze Age hoards. It is highly likely that this earlier find is directly related to the group herein described and may well be part of the hoard itself being the largest element of the group and most likely spotted within a ploughed field after being disturbed. Discussion and Dating:Elements within this hoard are relatively typical of small late Bronze Age ?mixed weapon and tool? assemblages reported from Western Britain and in particular Wales and the Shropshire Marches. A number of similar assemblages are known including hoards from Ystradgynlais - Penwylt, Breknockshire / Breconshire - now Powys (Savory 1980: 122 & 190 Cat No 284), Brogyntyn, Selattyn, Shropshire (ibid: 122 & 192 Cat No 288) and from the hillfort at The Breidden, Montgomeryshire (Musson 1991). What marks this hoard out though is the deliberately constructed multiple[le deposit within a socketed axe (1) and the variety of finds within the hoard.The elements within the hoard are noteworthy. The composite find (1) still needs detailed work to understand its comopnents and creation.The single axes (2&3) are best classified as being Faceted Socketed Axes, type Meldreth, possibly being sub-classified as a Variant Aylsham. This style / type of axe has a common distribution in the East of England. The majority of axes of this style have historically been found in the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire. The distribution pattern continues to a lesser degree in South-East England (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981: 211). However, a number of Meldreth Type axes have been found in hoards associated with South-Wales Types and Ewart Park Swords, for example the Stogursey Hoard, Somerset (ibid, 210). This is reflected in a local Marches distribution where they have been treated as exotics occurring in a Ewart Park phase hoard from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (Reavill 2005), and a complete example from Ellesmere (Reavill 2011) and a broken and damaged faceted axe from Westbury, Shropshire (Reavill 2008). These axes have been discovered in associated with the metalwork from the Ewart Park tradition (Metalworking phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-700 CAL. BC.The looped spearhead fragment (4) is the oldest artefact within the hoard, potentially being 100-300 years old when deposited. It is similar to looped spearheads that have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham?s Period 5 (c. 1500 ? 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated from, Llanbeblig, Caernarvonshire (Savory: 1980 ref: 230) and Nantcwnlle, Cardiganshire (ibid: 337:2). The metal of this latter example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC. This form of spearhead fits well with Davis?s (2012) new typology of spearheads being similar to his Group 6: Developed Side Looped; due to the nature of the fragment a sub-type cannot be suggested. The form of the two woodworking tools within the hoard are contemporary with the axes being associated with hoards of the final Bronze Age, the hoard from Brogyntyn, Selattyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980: 122 & 192 Cat No 288) contains two similar examples. Parallels for the tanged chisel (5) can also be seen within hoards such as Carlton Rode, Norfolk (REF) and from within Late Bronze Age material within a hoard of probable Early Iron Age datefrom Gussage St. Michael, Dorset (Knight, Ormrod & Pearce 2015: 51, no. 250b).   Gouges in the Bronze Age are relatively understudied. David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. The form of this gouge (6) might be most accurately placed within his Class I category, which is characterised by a plain collar and narrow blade. Classes of gouges are difficult to distinguish chronologically but can be broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age, particularly the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (c.1150-750 BC), though different forms continue in use into the Early Iron Age. Savory (1980, 55) has suggested that simple mouth mouldings on socketed gouges suggest a later date within the type, probably implying a Ewart Park date for the gouge.Copper alloy anvils (7) are rare in British contexts but are known from hoards - the form of this example is incomplete due to damage but seems to have multiple usable surfaces for working and manipulating metal (either gold or bronze) Armbruster (et. al. 2019) have catalogued and summarised the tool type and its distribution in the Middle-Late Bronze Age in Europe (I am grateful to Brendan O'Connor for providing me with this most up-to-date work). The inclusion of a personal item, the bi-fid razor (8) is also relatively unusual in such a relatively small hoard. The razor fits best with those ascribed to the Type Feltwell (Jockenhvel 1980) and dates from the Late Bronze Age from the Wilburton to the Ewart park phase, c.900-700 BC. Type Feltwell razors are common in Scotland and England, less so in Wales and Ireland. Rare examples can also be found on the Continent (Jockenhvel 1980; Plate 50, Map A).There is a similar Type Feltwell bifid razor (1998,0901.279) from the Salisbury Hoard at the British Museum which dates from Llyn Fawr phase of the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age, c.800-600 BC and Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar tanged bifid razor with vertical grooves from Camerton in Somerset (85, pl.12, no.366c.) Savory (1980:56) notes that a similar razor (with maple leaf form) was acquired by the National Museum of Wales in 1978 from Ogof-yr-esgyrn, Glyntawe, Breckonshire ? but this is not illustrated within his catalogue.The final well-worn cauldron handle (9) is also noteworthy. Cauldron finds are rarely discovered within Shropshire and the presence of this one within the hoard underlies its importance to the county narrative. Cauldrons are feasting vessels and the cauldron ring (which is worn through use) is essential as without it the cauldron (which holds  several gallons of liquid) cannot be used / suspended over a fire. Two cauldrons are known from Wales both being globular and squat they are both associated with wetland deposits having been deposited within shallow lakes / bogs at Llyn Fawr (ibid:  58) dated c. 750-450 BC. The cauldron ring from this hoard has a faceted angular section which is best paralleled to Class B1 cauldrons of the Atlantic / Western European tradition. These are paralleled on extant examples from Blynorig, Co Kerry Ireland (Gerlof Cat No39 p 146-7) and Kealanine, Co Cork (ibid Cat No 40, 147-8) which both are from the Irish Cauldron Type: Ballyshannon which is dated to the very final Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. Gerlof indicates that they are contemporary with Llyn Fawr cauldrons traditionally dated to the peiod c. 800-600 BC (ibid: 148-9)Therefore, all the elements within this hoard are consistent with metalwork of very Late Bronze Age or Bronze Age / Iron Age transition, most specifically with material from the Ewart Park metalworking tradition, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to c. 950 - 750BC and the Llyn Fawr Period Period 8 dated 750 ? 450 BC.Context:During the later Bronze Age a number of object types are often deposited together within specific locales in the landscape. These locales can sometimes be man-made structures such as hillforts or settlements, but are more commonly natural places often near water, such as spring heads, slow moving streams, or bogs / meres. It has also been noted (Bradley 1998 & Bradley 2016) that many of these objects represent offerings or gifts to deities, however, they also represent a deliberate public destruction of wealth and assets (conspicuous consumption) which may also cement social hierarchies within communities. As can be seen within this hoard, artefacts can be deliberately manipulated and their identities and biographies / life-stories combined. This can be seen specifically within the deliberate curation of antique artefacts (4) and the combined / amalgamated axe, gouge and fitting (1).Conclusion:There is no doubt that these fourteen objects (and the older discovery of a Ewart Park Sword) date from the same archaeological phase and were deliberately placed together in the ground around 3,000 years ago.Statement:This assemblage / hoard of fourteen artefacts described above should be considered as Treasure under the 2002 Treasure (Designation) Order to the Treasure Act 1996 (DCMS: 2002) due to the hoard being a base metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects from a closed context.The two later objects mentioned above are not eligible as they date from later periods and therefore cannot be said to come from the same ?closed context?. As such it is my opinion that they do not qualify under the Act and should be returned to the landowner and / or finder.References:Armbruster B. Jockenhovel, A.

The fragment is a short length of a straight, parallel sided strip with both ends bent back on themselves so the ends meet, probably originally making a cylindrical bead. This has then been squashed flat. The back (interior) is plain and the front is decorated with 20 regularly spaced parallel ribs, and 18 grooves between them, running along the entire length of the fragment.Dimensions: The fragment now measures 9.6mm long, is 13.8mm wide and 1.9mm thick with the single thickness of the strip being 0.3mm; it weighs 0.63g with some mud still inside.Discussion: The linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date including examples from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1980; Palmer 1980); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Hook, Hampshire (2014 T777), Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&b); Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672); and Tendring District, Essex (2012 T577). The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age.Several similar pieces have also been found bent into cylindrical beads and it is unclear if this was their original purpose or if this was a common reuse for parts of larger ribbon ornaments. A necklace of beads from Ireland is in the British Museum (BM 1853,0926.2) is similar but the beads are much more tightly wound cylinders.

The bead is classified as a perle tubulaires canneles (see Elure 1982, 30-31, 168-171).

The inner face of one of the terminals carries scratching, apparently relatively modern rather than ancient. The bracelet is distorted: one half of the bracelet has been pulled out of penannular form, possibly in relatively modern times and possibly related to the re-deposition of the bracelet (see circumstances of discovery).Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of two gold bracelets was undertaken at the British Museum. See appended report for the results. It should be noted that the gold and silver content of the two bracelets are distinct, suggesting a different production history.Discussion: Given the find context and composition, it is not possible to be certain of the circumstances of how the bracelets came to be deposited and whether they belonged to a larger ?hoard?. On the balance of probabilities, seems likely that they were deposited together, despite the difference in gold composition.The gold penannular bracelets with expanded D-shaped terminals belong to a well-known group of Late Bronze Age objects (Murgia et al. 2014, Section 3.8) and date to the period of 900-750 BC.Conclusion: Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996",,,"Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of two gold bracelets from the ?Essex county area? indicated the following approximate surface compositions:Bracelet        Lab. number         Au%           Ag%          Cu%       Weight/gSmaller         7663-12             c. 80-82      c. 12-14      c. 5-7        57.16Larger           7663-13             c. 64-66      c. 30-32      c. 4-6        138.75Department of Scientific ResearchThe British MuseumFile No. 7663-12-13 2017 T86725th February 2019",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-09-29T23:00:00Z,2017-09-29T23:00:00Z,Eastern,Essex,Uttlesford,"Restricted access","Essex County Area",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Acquired by Saffron Walden Museum (during Covid-19 so collection delayed).",639844,images/hfowler/,2017T867SmallerTorc.jpg,"Restricted info","Other chance find",,CAM,2017-10-02T12:14:31Z,2020-11-09T15:21:12Z

The surface comprises of a bright gold colour and is possibly silver rich but there does not appear to be definitive bands of lighter (silver-rich) gold. There does not appear to be any evidence of a copper core and the weight may indicate it is more likely the penannular ring is made of gold, rather than gold plated copper-alloy.

Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997).However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Elure 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). There are a number of examples known from Wales, Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).LANCUM-C2543F is the first complete example from Cumbria and the only other complete example known from the North West is from Wrenbury practically on the Welsh border. There is another broken example from West Cumbria manufactured from gold sheet rolled into a tube with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 80-82%, silver content of 14-15%, with at least 4% copper. The ring is formed from gold sheet rolled into a curved tube, with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. According to Gillian Varndell Curator, Department of Prehistory and Europe, British Museum. It is probably part of a well-known Bronze Age ornament type (composite ring) dating to c.1300-1100 BC. This find is also close to other gold finds from West Cumbria from a similar period consisting of a penannular bracelet and three lock rings. These finds are very significant for the North West in terms of high status Late Bronze Age activity.The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.ReferencesBritish Museum (2009) Portable Antiquities and Treasure Annual Report 2007, London: British Museum.DCMS (2002) The Treasure Act, Code of Practice (Revised) England & Wales, London: Department for Culture, Media and Sport.DCMS (2007) Treasure Annual Report 2004, London: Department for Culture Media and Sport.DCMS (2008) Treasure Annual Report 2005/6, London: Department for Culture Media and Sport.Dunne, C.M.

The strip has been worked and there are hammer facets visible on the flat surfaces and side margins. One edge has been hammered up and has a projecting margin on one face edge. The strip was broken at one end with a double-grip tool without sharp edges. As a result, there is widening, lateral distortion with thinning at one end, near the break. On one face, the break has created a near flat angled facet, while on the reverse there is a distinct concave curvature of the break, where gripped. The opposite end looks to have been snapped, rather than pulled, the break edge being irregular and with no thinning and minimal distortion of shape evident. Projecting burrs on the face edges look to have been hammered down. On one face, there is a linear crack evident in the metal along the axis of the strip, while a second smaller area of surface cracking is also evident. The gold has a yellowish tinge, rather than tending toward silver or having an orange hue.Dimensions: maximum length 12.7mm; maximum width 8.5mm; maximum thickness 2.8mm; weight 2.37g.",,,"Metallurgical analysis (Mary Davis)MethodSemi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold strip was undertaken for the gold, silver and copper content of the gold fragment. This was achieved using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HH-XRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6A for 100 live seconds.Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements.ResultsThree spectra were taken of the object, which was found not to be particularly homogeneous in composition, and the overall results averaged:Gold: 85-87%;Silver: 10-12%Copper: 2-2.5%InterpretationThe amount of copper and silver present in the gold fragment is consistent with a typical Bronze Age composition. The results sit within the known range of compositions of gold objects from Wales of either Middle or Late Bronze Age date (e.g. Gwilt et al 2005, 36 & Fig. 4).Identification & discussion (Adam Gwilt)As a fragment of semi-worked gold, it is not possible to identify this with certainty to a class of finished gold artefact type of known period or date. The hammering and working technique observed on this fragment (see above description) is consistent with observed Bronze Age working technology, however is not, in itself, diagnostic to a particular date.In this instance, it is the metallurgical analysis of the composition of this gold fragment which provides the most instructive evidence as to the possible age of this object. The high, but not refined gold content in this strip fragment, in the range of 85-87% gold and with 10-12% silver content is consistent with known Bronze Age gold compositions, to some degree reflecting the natural incidence of silver within alluvial gold ores. Copper was deliberately added to gold alloys in the Bronze Age, with the general trend for increasing proportions of copper with time, Late Bronze Age artefacts generally containing 4-10% copper and Early Bronze Age gold generally with less than 1% copper content (e.g. Hartmann 1980; Northover 1993, 517, Fig. 2). This strip, containing 2.0-2.5% copper sits in the overlap zone with other gold artefacts dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2005, 36 & Fig. 4). Typically, Roman gold is highly refined, with the silver and copper content removed, giving the metal a more reddish colour.Part-worked or re-worked fragments of Bronze Age gold are sometimes discovered, as single finds or as elements within hoards (e.g. Green 1983; Green & Northover 1996; Gwilt et al 2005; DCMS 2004, 19, Cat. & Fig. 11; DCMS 2007, 22-3, 26, & 39, Cats. & Figs. 5, 7, 17 & 25; British Museum 2008, 22 & 24, 273-5, Cats. & Figs. 27, 33 & 34). Their occurrence as single finds has been increasing in recent years, as better levels of reporting treasure finds have been achieved through the Portable Antiquities Scheme in England and Wales. Therefore, the possibility of this strip being a single find of Bronze Age date is also consistent with a wider reported pattern.A preliminary search of the Heritage Environment Record for Monmouthshire has indicated there are no known Bronze Age or prehistoric sites in the immediate landscape vicinity of the find-spot.AuthorsAdam Gwilt - Principal Curator: Prehistory, Department of History & Archaeology, Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum WalesMary Davis - Formerly Principal Analytical Services Officer, Department of Collections Services, Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum WalesReferencesBritish Museum 2008.

The broken opening is sub-rectangular in section and measures 22 mm long by 19 mm wide, internally. The blade is crescentic, 34 mm wide and 3 mm thick, but very worn but where the upper edge of the blade terminates the sides of the axe are pinched in to a 'V' shape, suggesting that the blade did not extend further out to the side. The two faces of the axe are decorated with three longitudinal ribs, on average 30 mm long and 2 mm wide, that are equidistant on one face but taper towards each other slightly on the other face.The socketed spearhead is leaf-shaped with what looks to be a narrow socket, but there are not enough fragments to reconstruct the socket. The point, which has been broken off deliberately, is 21 mm long, 15 mm wide and 6 mm in thickness.The other nine fragments pictured below have not been measured here but appear to be part of the socket.The penannular 'lock' ring or ornament has four concentric incised lines on the upper face and is 17.5 mm in diameter externally and 11 mm internally, and 4 mm in height / thickness.The awl is now 37 mm long but broken at both ends. It has a chisel tang at one end which is rectangular in section, 4 mm wide and 2 mm thick, and a stunted point which is circular in section and 3 mm in diameter.The embossed dome is 8 mm in diameter, 3 mm in height and 0.5 mm thick and has two trapezoidal opposing arms that are 4 mm wide and 4 mm long, alternating with two lips, which may have been mounted on to a bracelet similar to a ribbed and bossed bracelet excavated from Norton Fitzwarren hillfort in Somerset (Matt Knight pers comm). The five fragments pictured with it are not measured here and are from other objects.Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) note this ribbed bracelet with similar bosses as part of the assemblage from Norton Fitzwarren on p.67, no.410c, which dates from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age, and illustrate an awl with a rectangular section at one end and a blunted point, from Tarrant Rawston in Dorset, on pages 41 & 103, pl.30, no.314. which is recorded in DOR-6DF7F6 and dated from the Late Bronze Age.Savory (1980) illustrates several similar awls from Llandow, Glamorgan and Castell Bryngwyn, Llanidan, Anglesey in Wales, on p.199, fig.51, nos.440:2 & 486.The incomplete solid copper alloy penannular ring has the classic triangular cross-section and the incised concentric lines along the exterior that is typical of the gold sheet work found on penannular lock-rings, but this appears to be the first decorated bronze lock ring. There are plain bronze lock rings from Trapain Law in East Lothian, Scotland and Burwell Fen, Cambridgeshire illustrated in Eogan (1969) on pages 119 &128, no.27 and pages 121 & 134-5, no.31. The decorated bronze lock-ring from the first Gilmonby hoard, found near Bowes, Durham, is much larger and more biconical (Brendan O'Connor pers comm). There is an example recorded on the PAS database in record ESS-5ECCA2 that has similar concentric grooves and is smaller than this example, being only 14.5 mm in diameter, which is dated from c.1150-800 BC.Moore and Rowlands (1972) illustrate a small (16.5 mm in diameter) penannular lock ring found near Salisbury, Wiltshire on page 65, plate XVI, no.81.The axehead and spearhead are similar to a set of three objects: a crescentic blade from a socketed axe, a squat 'South Welsh' type socketed axe with side loop and three vertical ribs, and a leaf-shaped spearhead, likely found together near Dinton Beeches, Wylye parish in Wiltshire and illustrated by Moore and Rowlands (1972) on pages 57-58 & 60, plates X, XI & XII, nos.49, 54 & 66.Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a socketed axe with three converging ribs and a sub-rectangular section, from Kingsbridge in Devon, on pages 41 & 95, pl.22, no.139.Burgess (2012) illustrates similar South Welsh / Stogursey socketed axes with slightly converging ribs and a slightly expanded blade on page 239, fig.1Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate an incomplete Stogursey type socketed axe, but the lower section with the ends of the ribs and blade are missing, on page 136, fig.38, no.344, which dates from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.Pearce (1983) illustrates a socketed axe with three converging ribs from St Kew parish, Cornwall that is classified as a Stogursey type axe on page 412 & 570, pl.9, no.77.Savory (1980) illustrates South Wales type socketed axes with similar converging ribs from a hoard found at Penwyllt near Ystradgynlais, Powys in Wales on page 191, fig.43, nos.284:5-6.See NMGW-2AA743 for a very similar but incomplete three-ribbed South Wales type of socketed axe, where the ribs also converge slightly as they approach the blade end, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-800 BC.",,,"Dimensions below are for the socketed axe only, as the container, but the weight is the total weight of all of the objects.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-06-25T23:00:00Z,2017-06-25T23:00:00Z,"South West",Cornwall,Cornwall,"Restricted access",Madron,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to landowner after being disclaimed as Treasure",,1039670,images/atyacke/,lockringprofile.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,CORN,2017-07-13T11:40:25Z,2019-11-27T19:36:39Z

It dates broadly to the Middle Bronze Age and more specifically to the Taunton/early Penard phases (1400-1200 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).This is a complete palstave with leaf-shaped flanges that rise from the septum below the butt to about the height of the stop. It has a long slender butt, with a straight end and a thick septum (c.10mm). In plan, the flanges form a straight, rectangular stop ridge and taper in very slightly toward the butt end. A thick side loop is positioned on one side overlapping the stop ridge.The blade is broad and crinoline in shape, with a curved cutting edge and faint signs of a bevelled edge. The bevelling and curvature of the cutting edge indicates it was worked, which is supported by the slightly asymmetrical form of the edge. This may be the resulting of casting, uneven working or resharpening. There are no macroscopic sharpening or grinding striations visible. Both faces are adorned with a raised midrib, extending from below the stop about halfway down the blade (44.6mm long); it is more pronounced on one face than the other.There is a lateral flattened ridge down each side of the palstave, which indicates the remains of the casting flash which has been ground and hammered down, though it is particularly prominent around the side loop. Furthermore, there is a shallow shrinkage hollow in the septum at the stop on one face, which is a common flaw for palstaves, caused as the metal cools after casting.The palstave is covered in an even, consistent pale brown patina preserving the original surface. Active pale green corrosion is visible in small patches, particularly around the edges and fresh bronze can be seen on one side of the cutting edge indicating post-recovery damage. Patches of dark blue corrosion product can be seen on the septum on one face.Dimensions: Length: 167mm; Blade width 65.1mm; Butt width: 18.3mm; Stop breadth: 35.3mm; Stop width: 22.7mm; Flange breadth: 33.1mm; Flange height: 10mm; Weight: 503.4g.",,,"A wide variation of palstave types are known from throughout the Middle Bronze Age and this example has characteristics most similar with those from the Taunton phase (1400-1275 cal. BC), but could extend into the Penard phase (1275-1100 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997).Close parallels for this palstave are difficult to identify though. While it appears to fall broadly within Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III Low-flanged, it does not conform to any of their sub-types or variants. The combination of a broad crinoline blade, side loop and midrib is unusual. Additionally, the breadth of the flanges is quite large (33.1mm) - typically one would expect low flange breadth to fall below 31mm. In southern Britain, it most closely matches Rowlands (1976) Class 5, Group 1 of broad-bladed looped palstaves. Parallels with lower flanges can be seen in his catalogue from Watchingwell on the Isle of Wight (Rowlands 1976, No.576, Pl.31) and Northamptonshire (ibid, No.811, Pl.30). A similar palstave from Wales is recorded from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-CF16C3), though that example has a flared, triangular blade and lower flanges.The most similar example in terms of form and dimensions was found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012). Deep flanges and crinoline blades are a typical feature of palstaves from South West England and this palstave may indicate influence from this area.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wales,Powys,Powys,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder",,622078,images/mknight21/,2017142.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMGW,2017-07-12T12:33:29Z,2017-11-21T09:35:25Z

These appear to be integrally cast and have a circular cross-section. At each terminal the bar tapers just before the twisted flange ends.

The three gold plates, technically termed face plates, are sometimes decorated with repouss decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire work. More infrequently, lock-rings are made from face plates formed or constructed from individual gold wires fused together or from striped twisted gold wires soldered together (Murgia et al. 2014). The Hambledon lock-ring is an example of solid face plates decorated with incised decoration. These are relatively rare. Eogan (1969) recorded only three examples (Ibid., fig.4, nos. 39-40, 43) and only two of these (both found between Haverhill and Saffron Walden in Essex) carry decoration that closely resembles the Hambledon find: interlocking chevrons.A similar example of a triangular cross sectioned lock-ring can be found in ESS-5ECCA2 as well as three examples from LANCUM-C98FBF and two from LVPL-5DFE32.Lock-rings are known across Britain, Ireland and North-West France (see Eogan 1994, fig. 41).

The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan, with convex expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged, but appears to be symmetrical. The cutting edge measures 64.2 mm in width and is 3.0 mm thick.In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. It measures 31.2 mm in width and 27.7 mm thick at the stop ridge.Beneath the stop-ridge, on each face of the palstave, is a narrow concave depression, which is bordered by raised ridges. This is broadly sub-rectangular (U-shaped) and is usually described as shield shaped. It is visible on both sides, however it is obscured slightly on one face due to a casting flaw, an air bubble, being present. The shield measures 26.4 mm in width and 25.8 mm in length on the clearer face. Through this shield descends a vertical rib that extends to the mid point on the upper blade forming a trident like pattern.The palstave has a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The flanges are incomplete. At the stop ridge on one face the flange measures 11.7 mm in depth. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 24.2 mm in width and 5.2 thick. No side loop is present.Overall the palstave measures 169 mm in length, a maximum width of 64.2 mm, and a maximum thickness of 31.4 mm. It weighs 440.6 g.The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.Surface XRF analysis was carried out at Birmingham Museum Conservation Laboratory using a tabletop Mistral XRF machine.

The lock-rings are all made from gold sheet face plates that are bi-conical in form and triangular in section with central tubes and side plates formed from the same sheet and secured by a binding strip of round sectioned gold wire fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding to the rim. The face plates are all decorated with fine, narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates imitating fine wire works. Two of the lock-rings only differ by 1cm in width and 0.1 gram in weight indicting that they are a pair The third smaller lockring is singular however the similar form indicates the same craftsman or at least a the same workshop. The gold bracelet and smaller lock-ring are stained with what could be corrosion products but appears more like organic residue possibly from something in the soil or organic substances included at the time of deposition.Gold penannular bracelet with a lonzenge-shaped profile, no decoration and flattened slightly expanded to form plain circular terminals.The diameter is 68mm the width is 68mm thickness 6mm, 8mm at the terminals and the weight 66.15g. It shares similarities with a bracelet from Beachy Head in East Sussex  in the British Museum collection number 1824,K/Armilla.18.Lockring 1. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 34mm the width is 34mm thickness 11mm and the weight 8.24g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.A central circular opening to the ring - probably once approximately 15mm in diameter - is lined by a third sheet. In effect, this creates an interior but discontinuous tube, with a gap in the vertical plane for the terminal aperture. The top and bottom margins of the tube were folded over the interior rim of the two face plates, giving the ring some structural cohesion. It would appear that the triangular end faces at the terminals were once integral extensions to the interior tube.The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly creased and misshapen and at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube there is a small tear in the sheet and the concentric circle decoration is damaged through surface scarring. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.Lockring 2. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 34mm the width is 34mm thickness 10mm and the weight 8.34g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly creased and misshapen especially at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube and the concentric circle decoration is damaged through surface scarring. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.Lockring 3.

The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly stained from a residue on the surface that could be corrosion but appears to be more like organic residue. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.Cauldron fragment. The length is 27mm, the width is 31mm thickness 15mm and the weight 31.33g.Lockrings are normally found in pairs leading to theories of their use as ear rings or for hair decoration. Although this find is unusual in that there are three however it is extremely likely that two are indeed a pair. It is still not clearly known what the purpose of these objects are however it does seem likely that they are indeed some form or ornamentation probably jewellery. They are usually buried in isolated high places and often in or near hillforts and other prehistoric features such as stone circles such as these were. Investigation of the find spot has revealed that they appear to have been laid in a small hollow in silty clay sub-soil or directly on the prehistoric land surface in two small channels in the limestone bed rock and covered over with stones. The bracelet appears to be a part of the deposition as does the copper alloy cauldron fragment although this could have been residual in the soil. However it's direct proximity to the other objects means that is has to be and should be included in the hoard assemblage.DiscussionLockrings are a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007).The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525-9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Recently, a radiocarbon date has been obtained from a sample directly associated with a large hoard of bronze artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland. The sample of wood, surviving within the haft of a socketed axe, provided a date of 2771+-26BP, calibrating to 1000-840BC at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68-9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95-6; Lynch 1991, 239-41). What is generally agreed is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society. In Britain, the find-spots currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-western Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland and thirdly, East Anglia and south eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41). Their absence to date in the Midlands, mid and south Wales and south western England, with the single exception of one example from Somerset is marked and probably significant.Gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC); they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. The distribution of lock-rings shows a North British Group, a South British group, and a French group (Eogan 1969). The suggested date for this example is Late Bronze Age c.1150-800 BC. Similar penannular rings have been reported under the Treasure Act, for example 2014 T193 (ESS-C0C162) and 2012 T832 (SUSS-C65251).There are currently six lockrings in the British Museum collections. These new examples are very similar to one from Portfield Camp, near Whalley in Lancashire even to the binding strip consisting of a solid round sectioned wire. Museum Number 1966, 1208:1.They are also very similar to two discovered at Rossett in Wales in 2013 (LVPL-5DFE32) and semi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. Several readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6mA for 100 live seconds and quantified with the use of empirical calibrations. The average composition of the gold in freshly exposed and damaged areas was:- Gold 80-81%; silver 14%; copper 5%.The copper and silver contents matched with gold compositions from other Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts in Ireland and Wales, although the copper content is towards the lower end of the expected range for Late Bronze Age gold (e.g. Hartmann 1980, 158, Figs .12 & 36; Davis 2005, 36 & Fig. 4).ReferencesArmstrong, E.C.R. 1917 The Great Clare Find of 1854, Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland 47, 21-36.Cowie, T., O'Connor, B. & Proudfoot, E. 1991 A Late Bronze Age Hoard from St Andrews, Fife, Scotland: a preliminary report, In C.

In profile, it is of a lentoid (pointed oval), with tapering edges. The butt is almost square. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt, to a proto stop ridge, and then taper down to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, just forming a change of angle between the face of the butt and the face of the blade.From the blade to the proto stop ridge, decoration, in the series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. The side edges of the axe have an almost rope pattern, with two raised areas, suggestive of twisted rope. Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. No blade facet is present.The axehead measures 155.1 mm in length, 92.9 mm wide (blade), 28.1 mm wide (butt), 2.2 mm thick (butt), 12.4 mm thick (stop ridge), 2.0 mm thick (blade).

There are two lines of pointill&eacute; and two rows of bosses (five complete and two incomplete bosses on one row and five bosses and one incomplete boss on the other row). The fragment has be snipped along three edges, while the forth edge is ragged. Along the ragged edge are several small, intentional perforations. One edge has apparently been folded and unfolded - in antiquity or since discovery. The decorative bosses are all slightly flattened and scuffed. Around them it is possible to identify circles indicative of the stamp/tool used to fashion them (individually).Date:Probably Early Bronze Age (Embossed gold tradition: c. 2100 - 1700 BC)Dimensions: Length: 26mm; Width: 23mm; Thickness: c.0.2mm; Weight: 1.86gMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken by the Science department of the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 84-86% gold, 13-15% silver, the rest being copper. See appended report.Discussion: The combination of bosses and pointill&eacute; and the v-shaped furrows is a known (but rare) feature of the Early Bronze Age embossed gold tradition dating to the period c.2100-1700 BC (Needham 2000; Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 913-14). A hoard of goldwork from Woolaston, Gloucestershire (2013 T805; British Museum accession numbers 2016, 8011.1-8), included gold ornaments decorated with both pointill&eacute;, repouss&eacute; and with v-shaped furrows (Wilkin 2014), but circular bosses are not included among the decorative motifs. The exact dating of these objects is subject to debate but an early Middle Bronze Age date has been postulated based on morphological similarities (decorative and morphological parallels are not forthcoming). A strip with similar decoration was found at D&uacute;n Ailinne, Ireland, which has been dated to the Bronze Age generally (Fischer in Johnston &amp; Wailes [1984] 2007, 112-3). However, the closest parallel for the Rampisham fragment is, in fact, the Mold Gold Cape (British Museum accession number: 1836, 0902.1; Needham 2012), and the second cape fragment identified by Needham (Ibid.). The surface X-ray fluorescence analysis of the Rampisham fragment indicates a high silver content consistent with other objects of the embossed gold tradition, including the Mold Cape and the Lockington Armlets (Needham 2012, Table 2) and with the Woolaston ornaments (2013 T805).Conclusion: Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.References:Johnston, Susan A., Bernard Wailes, Pam J.

The majority of copper alloy fragments were found closely associated or together with the largest fragment (13) slightly further away (finders estimate 20m) and the gold bracelets together around two metres from the rest of the concentration. Two further fragments are thought to be lead-tin alloy and may relate to Post Medieval material found in the area rather than the hoards although tin beads are known from Devon hoards of the Bronze Age.Danielle Wootten (former Devon FLO) arranged re-excavation of the findspot and was able to establish the detectorists excavation holes. She confirmed (pers. comm.) the entire hoard had been retrieved and that the site appears to have been a boggy area with no obvious 'pits' in which the hoard (or hoards) were deposited and no other features associated with the hoard(s). The full report is awaited.Description: One or two hoards which may be associated and indeed have been deposited at the same time or separate times as part of an ongoing activity at the same site. One consists of copper alloy objects, the other of four gold bracelets.The group of copper alloy objects consists of: Fragment of sword blade. Broken at both ends, slightly wider at one end than the other, elliptical-section with bevelled edges. The edges of the blade have been hammer hardened. Breaks ancient. Surviving length 38.7mm. maximum surviving width 25.0mm. Weight 34.7g.Lower part of a socketed axehead. Mouth and loop missing, rectangular-sectioned body with casting seams on either side, flaring for the curved and corroded cutting edge. Both sides are indented before the break suggesting it may be deliberately broken. Surviving length 38.7mm. Cutting edge 39.6mm. Weight 45.0g.Part of the lower section of a socketed axehead with an old break which has removed one side and part of the blade. Mouth and loop missing, rectangular-sectioned body with casting seam on remaining side, flaring slightly for the curved and corroded cutting edge. The very end of the socket visible on the upper end. The curve of the cutting edge suggests only a small part of the side has been lost and the width is nearly complete at the blade. Surviving length 38.2mm. Cutting edge 27.6mm.

The strip has been straightened then one end bent over 180 degrees in an open curve. Small areas of creasing on the inner side at the centre and near one terminal.

Flat, broadly parallel sided strip narrowing slightly to each terminal. The terminals are rolled outwards and back on themselves one and a half times (480 degrees). The strip has slightly rounded sides. The strip has been straightened then one end bent over 180 degrees in an open curve. Length: 106mm folded, unfolded estimated at 160mm; width: 11.9mm at widest point, 10.6mm and 10.7mm at terminals; strip thickness: 1.1mm excluding terminals; weight: 19.63g.Gold penannular bracelet with flat rectangular sectioned body and back coiled terminals.

Flat, broadly parallel sided strip. The terminals are rolled outwards and back on themselves (at least c.270 degrees). The strip has slightly squared off sides. The strip has been straightened then one end bent over 180 degrees in an open curve. It has then further bent over again on itself at the point the terminal met the middle from the first fold. This fold is partially open and there is a small crack on the outer surface. Length: 65.0mm folded, unfolded estimated at 155mm; width: 14.6mm along its length; strip thickness: 1.0mm excluding terminals; weight: 23.81g.Metal composition of the gold bracelets (object nos. 15-18): Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the metal of the four bracelets at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 79-83% gold, 13-17% silver and at least 3-5% copper. See appended report for details.Discussion: The copper alloy element of the hoard finds close parallels among 'scrap' hoards of the Late Bronze Age in Southern England.The hoard contains a mixture of deliberately and possibly accidentally broken objects and ingots.The four bracelets in this hoard are highly constant in their form and modification by bending. The one example bent further may be accidental, probably at the time of deposition. Very similar gold strip bracelets are known from across Southern England including two from the relatively close by Colaton Raleigh Hoard (Taylor 1999) found 1986 and dated to c. 1000-650 BC, Treasure case 2009 T393 from Calborne on the Isle of Wight dated 1000-750 AD (Basford and Roberts 2009), examples from Tisbury, Wiltshire and Morvah, Cornwall (both Taylor 1980 pl 52e and 52d) and two in a hoard from Bexley Heath, Kent (Taylor 1999 pl.10).This hoard varies from the Colaton Raleigh and Bexley Heath hoards in having only one form of bracelet. It also varies in having the associated, spatially, and possibly chronologically, copper alloy hoard.Date: Late Bronze AgeConclusion: The prehistoric date and precious metal content of this find qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).Author: Laura Burnett, Finds Liaison Officer for SomersetDate: 11/04/2017Checked: Neil Wilkin, Curator, British MuseumReferencesBasford, F and Roberts, B.(2009) ""IOW-8BBE91: A BRONZE AGE BRACELET"" Web page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/262830 [Accessed: 11 Apr 2017 17:04:06]Taylor, J. 1980, Bronze Age Goldwork in the British Isles.

The strip of gold is sub-rectangular in plan, and is rolled up (width ways), forming a tight roll which has been slightly squashed into an oval shape (when viewed from the side). Eleven folds can be counted from the middle. There is some soil still attached to and within these folds. The strip is very thin (less than a diameter). The strip is wider in the middle than near the end, where it tapers from c. 21 mm in the middle towards 15 mm at the end (the end hidden in the folds in the centre of the bundle is also narrower than the middle). It becomes even narrower towards the very end, but how narrow cannot be assessed as the tapering end has been folded over backwards twice so that the very end of the strip is hidden between the first fold. The outer surface of the strip that can be seen (the rest being hidden between the folds) is undecorated, and has a pitted, uneven and slightly creased surface. There are also several small probable post-depositional scratches on the outer surface of the roll. A small cut or break is visible on the edge of the strip in the second and eighth fold, but they do not appear to extend across the entire width of the strip.Measurements: The rolled-up gold strip has a maximum height of 21 mm, a maximum width of 15 mm and a breadth of 12 mm. It weighs 15.09 g (including soil).Metal content: Analysis of the gold at the British Museum demonstrated that the object was 95-96% gold and has a composition consistent with a Bronze Age date.Discussion: This object would have been a long, narrow thin strip of gold tapering towards the ends. Unfortunately, due to its rolled-up condition, the ends in the strip described here cannot be seen, so any possible perforations, if present, are not visible. Unlike several other gold strips of Bronze Age date (e.g. WMID-FE3C28, NMGW-39F32D no. 1, KENT-D13625, BERK-BA8440, HAMP-36C41B, PAS-067AC5), this strip does not seem to have been decorated. Such plain gold strips without any archaeological context present problems for dating. They are relatively undiagnostic examples of Bronze Age goldwork in Southern England (c.2500-800 BC) and parallels are hard to find (cf. Murgia et al. 2014). However, there are a few similar objects. In France there is an example of a plain tapered strip of gold from the Saint-Babel hoard. It was rolled up in a very similar way as the strip discussed here (Elure 1982, 114, pl. 137). However this strip or bracelet is a lot thicker and shorter than the strip discussed here. Another plain strip of gold with a tapered end and two small perforations was found in an Early Bronze Age Breton hoard, but unfortunately this piece is incomplete so its length cannot be assessed (Elure 1982, 57 pl. 68). Another object in continental Europe which is similar to the strip described here is illustrated and described as a diadem by Perea (1991, 50); it comes from a Chalcolithic collective tomb at Cueva de los Murcilagos, Granada, in the south of Spain. However, the object is a lot wider in the middle than the strip described here. In Ireland a plain gold strip with rounded, tapered ends was found in Co Cavan (Taylor 1980, pl. 28 g,h & i), but this strip was decorated and only 285 mm long.In the UK there also are a few parallels for this object. CORN-8EC344 for instance, is a plain gold strip with tapered, rounded ends that have been folded over. There are punch holes inside these folded terminals which may have held a nail. Another plain gold band (or 'ribbon') folded over on itself to create four layers was found in West Mersea Essex (ESS-9D1D4A) and this only had one perforated terminal. A similar possible Bronze Age plain gold band or 'ribbon' was found in Dorset (DOR-52C762). This band is broken at one end and the other tapers to an unperforated terminal. A plain gold strip from the Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-09A1A5), with perforated and folded terminals, is dated from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1300 BC) (Portable Antiquities and Treasure Annual Report 2008 273, no.24, 42). A hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire had two items that may be comparable; a gold securing strip with perforated folded terminals from a gold armlet or cuff, and incomplete crushed gold armlet formed of a plain strip with tapered terminals (Savory 1980, 125, 195, fig.47, nos. 1 and 4). This hoard is dated to the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC (bid. 125).However, the closest parallels for this rolled-up gold strip are two possible diadems or neck-chokers. The first of these was found near Winchester in Hampshire (HAMP-AEA895). This is a long, cigar shaped strip of sheet gold with tapered ends. Both ends have three small perforations set in a triangle. The transverse creases in this strip (which was unrolled) are consistent with it having been rolled up and crushed flat, in a very similar way as the object described here. This deliberate destructive treatment (folding, rolling, damaging) is fairly common in Bronze Age objects that are deposited as part of a hoard. The second 'diadem' comes from Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire (WAW-FF1E9A). It is broken into two pieces, but they appear to have formed a long slender sheet of gold with tapering ends. Both ends have three small perforations. Unlike the first example, the edge of this sheet is decorated with a border of fine pointille decoration and although the sheet was crumpled, it was not folded.Based in the available parallels, the rolled-up gold strip can be assigned to the Bronze Age and deserves further research.",,,"In terms of age and precious metal content, the object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eastern,Essex,Chelmsford,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,604284,images/ianr/,2016T187b.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,PAS,2017-03-01T14:34:13Z,2017-12-06T11:24:37Z

In profile it is broadly lentoid (pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge. It seems most probable that the axe was cast in an open mould. All the diagnostic elements of the axe are lost (such as shape of butt and hafting specifications). The condition of the axe is poor - the majority of the surface patina has been removed by laminating corrosion, which appears to be active. The axe measures 77.6 mm in length, it is 34.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 75.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 8.7 mm, the blade is 2.8 mm thick. It weighs 253.6 g.The object is a dark brown in colour with an uneven patina. Areas of green active corrosion are present on the surface of the object. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of much of the original surface detail. From the blade shape (which could be described as fan-like) it is probable that the axe falls into the Migdale tradition of metalworking. This fits with the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC. Axes such as this are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The ring is formed from a short length of gold rod whose external edges have been shaped to form an irregular sub oval shape / cross section. This rod has then been subsequently shaped to form an open-ended ring. The two opposing terminals are relatively well aligned and are unexpanded and undecorated. Sub-rectangular depressions are present on both terminal faces but there is no evidence of applied foil or sheet metal end-caps. On the upper edge of one terminal is a deep V sectioned linear scratch, this is likely to have been applied whilst the rod was being measured and might indicate that the ring was cut into shape using a blade. A slight lip is present on the internal edge, again possibly being a relic of construction. There is no decoration present at all; likewise, there is no evidence of corrosion. Slight abrasion in the soil has resulted in surface scratches and there are compression tension lines, at right angles to the ring in plan, are evident in the surface on the interior face, suggesting that the ring was formed from an oval sectioned gold rod. The surface and terminals of the ring have been examined under high (x30) magnification and the surface of the ring is smooth and unblemished. All this suggests that the ring is formed of solid metal and does not have a copper core and applied foil surface like some examples within this artefact type / form.Dimensions:Weight: 5.33 grams; Length 13.1mm, width, 15.2mm, thickness 3.9mm - gap between opposing terminals: 2.4mmDiscussion:The penannular ring belongs to a relatively common class of treasure artefact which has been erroneously termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money'. Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange' (Gwilt, Lodwick and Davies 2014). The form of this example fits best with Meeks, Craddock and Needham's type or Group Ia - Plain Gold (2008: 17), although they note that some of these are cast. This group formed the most common / largest group within their study.The national distribution of this form of late Bronze Age artefact indicates that penannular rings are more common in the south and east of England with very few known in Northern Britain and Wales. Significant examples are also known from Ireland (Taylor 1980; Eogan 1994 and 2007; Raferty: 2004) and recent examples from Western Britain have a distinct Irish seaboard distribution. Gwilt et. al. (2014) define and discuss the known Welsh examples. However, this new example from Dorestone seems to be the first example to be recorded from either Herefordshire or the wider Welsh Marches area.Statement:Consequently, in terms of age and precious metal content, the object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.References:Eogan, G.

The object weighs 6.89g.Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of a gold torc fragment indicated a surface composition of approximately 94-97% gold, 3-5% silver, the rest being copper (see appended report for details).Discussion and Date: It was originally believed that this gold torc fragment may belong to the Middle Bronze Age based on parallels to a known type of fragment dating to the Penard period (c.1300 - 1150 BC). However, on closer examination it was recognised that the form and decoration (i.e. twist) of the torc is not similar to Bronze Age torcs and the composition of the goldwork is also dissimilar to Bronze Age torcs (see Murgia et al. n.d.). Wider consultation was made among specialist colleagues at the British Museum but the object could not be securely dated as ancient (over 300 years old) and can therefore be disclaimed as a case of Treasure.Conclusions:This object contains more than 10% precious metal but it cannot be shown to be over 300 years old. Consequently, in terms of age and precious metal content, the object does not qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Reference: Murgia, A., Melkonian, M. & Roberts, B.W.

Decorated gold strip fragmentDimensions: Maximum surviving length (bent) 38.9mm; maximum width 7.0mm; thickness approx. 0.3mm; surviving weight 2.40g.This is a highly decorated gold strip, with one surviving and slightly convex terminal, which has been carefully shaped and smoothed along its edge. A small pin perforation is located near the terminal at mid-width across the strip. The perforation is 0.4mm in diameter, centring approximately 0.7mm from the terminal edge of the strip. The perforation is not perfectly round having hexagonal facets with rounded edges. At the opposite end, the strip has been deliberately cut with a straight bladed tool, such as a knife. On one side, linear grooves indicate unsuccessful cut marks partly through the metal and at a slight angle to the cut edge. Four parallel linear zones of punch or stamp decoration in repeated flattened S-shaped motifs have been applied along the long axis of the strip. The overall effect is to resemble twisted wire stranding, but in one integral piece. While the back of the strip is flat, the upper decorated face has been grooved between each stamp zone and creating defined plain strip margins, approximately 0.6mm wide. The grooves are wide and curved, setting the stamped decoration in relief and creating a corrugated effect on the front face.2. Twisted bronze torc fragmentDimensions: maximum surviving length 170mm; internal diameter 160mm; maximum diameter of bar 7.7mm; surviving weight 52.5g.This is a near half fragment of a twisted bronze torc with a plain and tapering terminal. The twists are tightly spaced with an S-shaped curve. The twisting ceases to be evident towards the tapering terminal, starting to become apparent some 73.0-74.0mm from the surviving terminal end. The twists are far more pronounced on the interior surfaces and markedly worn around the external circumference surfaces, suggesting significant use-wear prior to burial. The bar is very slightly oval in shape, wider in the horizontal axis. The torc has been dented in two places, probably during recent retrieval, with fresh bronze metal showing at one point. The torc has a grey-green patination, which is slightly lighter than most other torc fragments (Nos. 3-8 below). The terminal end is fragile, with light green patination.3. & 4. Twisted bronze torc fragments (conjoining)Dimensions: combined surviving length approx. 144.0mm; surviving length of fragment 3- 125.9mm; surviving length of fragment 4- 33.2mm; internal diameter of collar 170-180mm; maximum diameter of bar 8.0mm; surviving weight fragment 3 - 30.6g; surviving weight of fragment 4 - 1.9g; combined surviving weight 32.5g.These are two conjoining fragments of a twisted bronze torc with a plain tapering terminal and combining to represent a one third fragment of the original whole artefact. The twists are tightly spaced with a Z-shaped curve. The twisting only ceases to be evident on the small terminal fragment, which is 33.2mm long, although missing its tip. The twists are evident on both interior and exterior surfaces of the torc, suggesting moderate use wear prior to burial. The bar is very slightly oval in shape, wider in the horizontal axis. A good conjoin is evident between the soil covered fragments. At the non-terminal end, the twisted upper surface has been shaved off, revealing bronze metal at the surface, and the end break is not fresh. There is differential corrosion and pock-marking on one surface, where the patination is a lighter grey green. The reversed surface is in better condition and has a dark grey-green patination.5. & 6. Twisted bronze torc fragments (conjoining)Dimensions: combined surviving length approx. 50.9mm; surviving length of fragment 5 - 38.2mm; surviving length of fragment 6 - 13.2mm; internal diameter of collar approx. 160-190mm; maximum surviving diameter of bar 7.1mm; surviving weigh of fragment 5 - 6.8g; surviving weight of fragment 6 - 1.0g; combined surviving weight 7.8g.These are two conjoining fragments of a twisted bronze torc with a plain tapering terminal and combining to represent a small terminal fragment of the original whole artefact. The twists are tightly spaced with a Z-shaped curve. The twisting only ceases to be evident approximately 26.0-27.0mm from the tapering terminal end, however the terminal tip has broken off and is absent. The twists are visible on both interior and exterior surfaces of the torc, suggesting moderate use wear prior to burial. The bar surfaces are damaged, making accurate estimations of its original shape and diameter difficult to ascertain. A good conjoin is evident between the sharply defined break points at the terminal end, however the break at the non-terminal end is soil covered and less fresh looking. The surfaces are pock-marked and corroded in places with a lighter grey green patination, however the majority of original surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.7. Twisted bronze torc fragmentDimensions: surviving length 36.8mm; maximum diameter of bar 8.7mm; surviving weight 10.7g.This is a small mid-section fragment of a twisted bronze torc. The twists are tightly spaced with a Z-shaped curve. The twists are visible on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the torc, suggesting moderate use-wear before burial. The breaks are soil covered, one end break being defined and the other looking more worn. One upper or lower surface has been recently damaged with a linear scar, revealing bronze metal. Original surfaces have a green-grey patination, while damaged surfaces and breaks have a lighter grey-green patination.8. Twisted bronze torc fragmentDimensions: surviving length 24.4mm; maximum diameter of bar 8.2mm; surviving weight 6.9g.This is a small mid-section fragment of a twisted bronze torc. The twists are tightly spaced with a Z-shaped curve. The twists are visible on both interior and exterior surfaces of the torc, suggesting moderate use-wear before burial. The breaks are soil covered, one end break being defined and the other looking more worn. One surface is more corroded than the other. The fragment has a dark grey-green patination.9. & 10. Decorated bronze bracelet of Liss Type (conjoining fragments)Dimensions: combined surviving length approx. 77.0mm; external diameter approx. 80-90mm; surviving length fragment 9 - 66.2mm; surviving length of fragment 10 - 28.9mm; maximum width bar 16.0mm; maximum thickness bar 7.5mm; surviving weight fragment 9 - 50.2g; surviving weight fragment 10 - 15.7g; combined surviving weight 65.9g.These are two conjoining fragments of a substantial bronze bracelet, in combination representing a little under half of the original complete object. In plan, the hoop is oval in shape, while in section, it is D-shaped, with a convex external surface. On the internal surface, slightly offset from the mid line is a continuous ledge running in parallel with the bracelet sides. This would appear to be a casting join, created by imperfections in the mould or poorly aligned mould pieces. The internal profile has a very slight convexity, but most closely resembles a D-shaped form, rather than an oval section. Along the small bracelet fragment, there is a slight tapering of the bracelet width, suggesting this was once a penannular bracelet with tapering terminals. Upon close inspection under the microscope, incised linear decoration is evident in places along the hoop of the bracelet. This appears to have been worn away in places through use. The breaks on the bracelet are soil covered, however the join is conclusive and the end breaks also appear well-defined, rather than worn. One exterior side of the hoop is differentially corroded and pitted, while there are localised patches of pitting and corrosion on the interior surface. The original surfaces have a dark grey-green patination, while corroded surfaces have a lighter grey green patina.11. Probable ribbed bronze bracelet fragment of Ramsgate TypeDimensions: surviving length 27.2mm; interior diameter approx. 50-60mm; maximum width 14.2mm; maximum thickness 2.4mm; surviving weight 3.7g.This is a small fragment, probably once belonging to a ribbed bronze bracelet. The curvature of the hoop fragment suggests an original internal diameter in the 50-60mm range, consistent with a small bracelet. The fragment has three ribs, and two grooves on its outer face, running in parallel with the axis of the hoop. One rib is central and the other two define the margins of the hoop. The interior surface of the bracelet is flat. While no conjoin exists between this fragment and fragment 12, it is probable that they once belonged to the same bracelet. Areas of corrosion and pitting are evident on the exterior surface, while the breaks appear worn. Original surfaces have a dark grey-green patination, while corroded surfaces have a lighter green patina.12. Probable ribbed bronze bracelet fragment of Ramsgate TypeDimensions: surviving length 19.4mm; maximum width 13.4mm; maximum thickness 2.5mm; surviving weight 2.2g.This is a small fragment, probably once belonging to a ribbed bronze bracelet. The fragment is curved along its length, however its original internal diameter cannot be accurately estimated. The fragment has three ribs and two grooves on its outer face, running in parallel with the axis of the hoop. The interior surface of the bracelet is flat. While no conjoin exists between this fragment and fragment 11, it is probable that they once belonged to the same bracelet. The external face of this fragment is well worn and corroded. Original surfaces have a dark grey-green patination, while worn and corroded surfaces have a lighter green patina.13. & 14. Swollen-shaft / Picardy related pin (conjoining fragments)Dimensions: surviving length of head fragment 13 - 71.9mm; surviving length of shaft fragment 14- 62.6mm; maximum surviving diameter of head 9.5mm; maximum diameter of neck (fragment 13) 7.4mm; diameter near broken tip (fragment 14) 2.9mm; surviving weight (fragment 13) 13.4g; surviving weight fragment 14 - 6.3g; combined surviving weight 19.7g.These are two conjoining fragments of a largely complete bronze pin, with a distinct swelling evident on the upper shaft. The head of the pin is damaged around its sides, although the original form appears to have been an expanded circle in plan with a dished and concave profile, with no evidence of decoration. The shank tapers towards the tip end, however the tip of the pin is missing, the break being soil covered and worn. Near the broken tip (the lower 9-10mm), the shank has been significantly bent, leaving expanded stress lines on the outer side, opposite to the direction of bending. The pin is undecorated and there is no visible evidence of a perforation through the neck. The conjoining breaks are soil covered and not particularly fresh looking, however the join is certain and convincing. The pin has localised areas of corrosion and pitting along surfaces and breaks. Original surfaces have a dark grey-green patination, while corroded surfaces have a lighter green patina.15. & 16. Dirk & loose rivet (Group IV dirk, with Archaic Group II Affinities)Dimensions: surviving length 123.3mm; maximum surviving width of butt 56.5mm; maximum blade thickness (upper blade) 6.1mm; maximum diameter of attached rivet head 10.7mm; length of attached rivet 18.3mm; maximum diameter of loose rivet head 10.5mm; length of loose rivet 18.1mm; surviving weight of dirk 90.8g; weight of loose rivet 7.2g; combined weight 98.0g.This is a short bronze dirk of ogival form (No. 15), with a wide and low butt. The butt has two corner placed rivet holes, both now damaged and open along the butt edge. One large, round-headed rivet survives intact with the blade. The extant rivet has widened heads of domed form, with a maximum diameter of 10.7mm. Original surviving edges at the top of the butt show a flat ended form, however the side edges of the butt are damaged, making it difficult to estimate whether the original form was square, angular, trapezoidal or curved in shape. At the top of the blade, the interface with the butt is marked with an omega shaped hilt-mark on both surfaces. The blade has a flattened mid-blade, with an overall slightly rounded profile. One blade surface has multiple linear hammer marks at the upper end and at right angles to the axis of the blade edges. Towards the top of the blade, on both surfaces, there is a reversed V-shaped thickening of the blade, coming to an apex at the butt end. The tip end of the dirk is missing, although it is probable that the blade was originally less than 150mm long. The blade has a dark grey green patination. One surface has localised bronze concretions, and these and unstable blade edges have a light green patination.A second loose rivet (No. 16), found some distance from the dirk, has very similar size and proportions to the attached one, with widened circular heads, dome shaped in section. Original surfaces have a dark grey-green patination, while the more corroded heads have a lighter green patina.17. Palstave (Group III Low-flanged (Broad-blade) Palstave)Dimensions: length 149.8mm; surviving blade width 56.6mm; butt width 22.5mm; weight 392.9g.This is a complete bronze looped palstave of slender proportions but broad-bladed form, with a single midrib extending down at least two thirds of the length of the blade. The body tapers slightly beneath the stop, while the sides are straight and divergent, down to the recurving of the blade edge. The loop is narrow, overlapping with the positioning of the stop. The flanges are convex, curved and widest above the stop, merging with the septum short of the butt end. The septum represents less than half of the length of the palstave and has a central rib on both faces. The stop is curved, while the butt end is straight and angular. The blade edge is deeply curved and expanded, with protruding blade tips. The casting seam is off centre, indicating one mould part deeper than the other. The seam has been filed or hammered down, but still visible and slightly protruding. On the loop side, there are slight indentations below the loop, possibly hammer marks. On the blade bevel, there are hammer marks, while striations are evident at right angles to the blade edge, suggesting the blade was sharpened for use. On one blade bevel surface is a long prominent surface scratch, possibly made in antiquity. The palstave has a mid to dark grey green patination, with localised bubbling concretions. The blade edge is fragile, with one or two recent chips to the edge, with a light green patination.18. Semi-worked barDimensions: surviving length 66.8mm; maximum diameter of head 7.7mm; diameter shank 5.7-6.5mm; thickness flattened tip 4.0mm; surviving weight 14.1g.This is a semi-worked bar, with circular section and a slightly flattened circular shaped head. The tip end is slightly flattened and tapering. Below the head, there is slight grooving and ridging parallel to the axis of the bar. The head and tip ends appear worn, while the bar has a grey patination.19. Circular flat-headed rivetDimensions: diameter of head 10.1mm; maximum surviving length 3.8mm; surviving weight 0.9g.This is a probable circular rivet head of copper alloy. The head is flat on the upper surface, while on the underside there is a ledge and circular thickening, conical in side view. At the centre of this thickening, there is a circular hollowing or depression, approximately 1.8mm in diameter, perhaps a point of attachment with a now absent component. The object has a dark green patination.20. Flattened sheet edgeDimensions: surviving length 34.7mm; maximum width 9.2mm; sheet thickness 1.3mm; weight 3.6g.This is a small copper alloy sheet fragment with a T-shaped section, suggesting a flanged edge or rim. Along the top and outer side, there are scored or incised lines. Although now bent from original shape, this fragment has a curvature suggesting it was once from a circular object. All breaks are worn and soil covered. The object has a dark green brown patination.21. Flat lump with vesiclesDimensions: length 36.0mm; width 31.2mm; thickness 4.7mm; weight 7.6g.This is a thin but amorphous fragment of copper alloy with undulating and rounded surfaces indicating it solidified from a lump of unformed molten state. The fragment has two small holes through its surfaces and vesicles suggesting gas holes or bubbling. The edges are worn. The fragment has a dark green patination, while the worn edges are lighter green in colour.22. Copper alloy lumpDimensions: length 22.8mm; width 19.6mm; thickness 11.6mm; weight 13.1g.This is a small and sub-rounded lump of copper alloy, of amorphous shape and formed by the solidification of a lump in unformed molten state. The fragment has irregular pitted surfaces, with vesicles suggesting gas holes and bubbling. The edges are worn and the fragment has a light green patination.23. Copper alloy pot or cauldron leg - late Medieval to early post-MedievalDimensions: maximum length/base diameter 56.1mm; maximum width 36.2mm; maximum height 20.2mm; weight 109.2g.This is a semi-circular wedge-shaped piece of copper alloy, containing significant black inclusions within the metal. The upper point of attachment to the original vessel is shaped as a flat segment of a circle, with a diameter of 56.1mm, the inner face being curved. The outer face is straight. The object has broken so that only the upper portion survives, the tapering foot being missing. The upper outer face is flat, with a central ridge evident, running parallel with the axis of the foot. All surfaces are very worn and pitted and the break is old. The lump has a grey-green patination.24. Flint flakeDimensions: length 24.9mm; width 17.2mm; thickness 6.5mm; weight 2.4g.This is a small flake of flint of mottled pale brown colour. Small areas of original natural nodule surface are evident, however the majority of surfaces are fresh as struck, with typical conchoidal fracturing evident. This flake is the bi-product of human flint working, rather than being a worked implement.The results show that the majority of objects (Numbers 1-17) are consistent with a Middle Bronze Age date and compositions. The majority of the twisted neck ring fragments (Numbers 3-8) vary in composition to some degree, but the general pattern of major and trace elements suggest they are from the same object; the exception to this is the largest fragment (Number 2) which is deliberately leaded.Objects 18-23 have compositions suggesting a Roman or later date, but probably modern. Fragment 23 may also be identified on stylistic grounds as being of late Medieval to early post-Medieval date.Identifications (AG)Seven fragments of bronze twisted torcs or neck-rings (Nos. 2-8 above) are included within the artefact group. The survival of two terminals amongst these indicate that they had tapering and plain terminals, while the contrasting twist patterns, metallurgical compositions and wear patterns between half fragment 2, with fragments 3-8 (including terminal fragments 5 & 6), indicate that at least two partially surviving torcs are represented in the group. These twisted torcs or neck-rings are a recognised artefact class belonging to the so called 'Ornament Horizon' of the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age (e.g. Smith 1959a; 1959b; Butler 1963; Rowlands 1976, 88-91; O'Connor 1980, 79-80 & 461-3, List 40; Eogan 1983, 27-8, No. 7, Fig. 6A; Roberts 2007). Torcs with plain tapering terminals are less common than torcs with hooked terminals, however a good British parallel is a single torc with plain tapering terminals in the Hollingbury hoard in Sussex (Butler 1963, 138; Rowlands 1976, 90 & 267, Cat. 143, Pl. 60; O'Connor 1980, 79 & 462, List 400; Roberts 2007, 161, No. 85). Bronze twisted torcs are frequently found in hoards in South Western England, with especial concentrations in Somerset, Dorset and South Wiltshire, with a few in Hampshire and Sussex and a cluster in East Anglia (Rowlands 1976, 88-9, Map 22; Roberts 2007, 142-6, Figs 4-6 & Table 2).The two clearly conjoining fragments of decorated bracelet (Nos. 9 & 10 above) may be identified as Liss Type, with incised decorative motifs (Needham 1989, 36-7). These have been related to the similar Bignan Type decorated bracelets of Brittany (Briard 1965, 123-35; Rowlands 1971), although they are part of a wider North European tradition (O'Connor 1980, 81-3; Needham 1989, 36). However, the distinctive decorative variations on the known British examples suggest there were regional places of casting and making, so that it is likely that many were made in Britain, rather than solely being Continental imports. These heavy cast decorated bracelets and armlets have been convincingly dated to the so called 'Ornament Horizon' of the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age, through their combination of hoard associations (e.g. Rowlands 1971, 193-6; O'Connor 1980, 80; Needham 1989, 38; Roberts 2007), dating to 1400-1275cal BC (Needham et al 1997). This bracelet from Llantrisant Fawr was once of oval shape, with observed slight tapering of the hoop width observed, suggesting this part is nearing an original terminal, now lost. It suggests that it was once an example of penannular, rather than annular form (Rowlands 1971, 186, Fig 1; O'Connor 1980, 81).The two ribbed and curved strip fragments (Nos. 11&12, above) can be identified as probably belonging to a single, narrow and cast bronze bracelet of Ramsgate Type (Piggott 1949, 120-1 & Fig. 6; Butler 1963, 155-7; Rowlands 1976, 91-2; O'Connor 1980, 85-6, 465-6, List 42 & Map 20; Needham 1989, 35). Although no join can be established between the two fragments, their closely similar style and dimensions, combined with very similar metallurgical composition, would strongly support their once belonging to the same bracelet. A number of hoards and settlement finds from Wiltshire and Somerset include examples of these bracelets (Smith 1959b, GB 42 & 44; Rowlands 1976, 251, 257, 260, 271, 277-8, Cats. 111, 115, 123, 154, 171-2; O'Connor 1980, 465-6, List 42; Needham 1989, 29-39). These can be securely dated to the so called 'Ornament Horizon' occurring during the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age, dating to 1400-1275 cal BC (Needham 1989, 38; Needham et al 1997; Roberts 2007, 141).The conjoining fragments of pin (No. 13-14 above) may be identified as belonging to a pin form with characteristic swollen-shaft and related to Picardy pins (Hawkes 1942; O'Connor 1980, 76-7, List 37; Roberts 2007, 139-40 & Fig. 3). These have been identified as a diagnostic ornament type of the so called 'Ornament Horizon', belonging to the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1275 cal BC). In the past, the similarities of such pins with pins from north-eastern France were emphasised by researchers (e.g. Hawkes 1942; Smith 1959a, 161-2; O'Connor 1980, 76-7), hence their name, however the proliferation of swollen-neck pin discoveries in England has recently led researchers to question their origin. Although this example is not decorated with incised ornament, as most of the typical examples are, the circular dished top and swollen-upper shaft in combination are chronologically diagnostic.The combination of features evident on the dirk (No. 15 above) enable an identification as a Group IV dirk with Archaic Group II affinities (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 63-5). As a Group IV weapon, it is characterised by having a blade with a flattened to slightly rounded centre-section, however its low butt, relatively wide and short blade, ogival shape with an omega hilt-mark and two rivets in rivet holes at butt corners indicate typological similarities with earlier Group II dirks with Low or Angular Butts (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 27-8 & 30-1). Group IV dirks with Archaic features are typologically earlier than Group IV dirks of the Appleby Series (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 106) and have been found elsewhere in hoards belonging to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Hemp 1917-18, 168-9; Piggott 1949; Smith 1959b; RCAHMW 1960, l & liv, Fig. 13, Nos. 3-8; Rowlands 1976, 229, 234-5, Cats. 21, 43 & 130 & Pl. 23; Burgess & Gerloff 1981, Cats. 29, 45, 296, 482, 497, 504, 567 & 572; 9, 11, 39 & 65, 67-8, 73-4; Pearce 1983, 439, Cat. 219, Pls. 28,101,142; Northover unpublished H25). The loose rivet (No. 16 above) has very similar dimensions and a similar metallurgical composition to the rivet still attached to the dirk. Although discovered dispersed from the dirk by approximately 8-9 metres, it is possible to be confident that it was once attached to this dirk.The palstave, which was discovered beneath the dirk and in the same detector pit, may be identified as a Group III Low-Flanged and Broad-blade palstave, most similar to the Type Carlton, Variant Kirkowan identified for Northern Britain (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 139-40). This also equates with Class 5, Group 1 palstaves of Southern Britain (Rowlands 1976, 34-6), which have a long blade length in relation to the septum length. Group III Low-Flanged and Broad-blade palstaves may be dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Northover unpublished, 163-85; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 1400, which has now been radiocarbon dated to 1400-1275 cal BC (Needham et al 1997, 82).In seeking to identify the narrow decorated gold strip fragment (No. 1 above), it has proven difficult to find an exact parallel with this piece. Gold artefacts found in direct association with bronze torcs, bracelets and pins of the 'Ornament Horizon' and belonging to the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age are uncommon. Nevertheless, it is possible to draw upon a number of the stylistic features of this strip and to correlate them with both bronze ribbed bracelets of Ramsgate Type and with occasional gold bracelets from Britain and Ireland. These suggest that this gold strip may once have been part of a narrow bracelet and contemporary with the other bronze objects in this artefact group. The ribbed and grooved upper surface and flat back surface of this decorated gold are similar to the ribbed bronze bracelets of Ramsgate Type.The metallurgical compositions of the remaining metal fragments reported (Nos. 18-23 above) have been established as being inconsistent with a Bronze Age composition and technology (Davis, above). The presence of zinc in fragments 18-20 and 22-3 indicates a Roman or later date technologically, although on balance they are most likely to be modern, while the composition of fragment 21 is also likely to be modern. Fragment 23 can be identified as part of a late Medieval to early post-Medieval pot- or cauldron-leg, therefore not contemporary or related to the other artefacts in the group (i.e. fragments 1-17). As such, fragments 18-23 may be deemed as not directly associated with the Bronze Age artefacts identified within this group, and not treasure. The flint flake (No. 24 above) is a non-diagnostic flake, rather than a tool or weapon, probably of prehistoric and Neolithic to Early Bronze Age in date. Although it is of interest to note its discovery, in terms of an earlier prehistoric landscape human presence in the area, it is not contemporary with the other main artefacts in the reported group, therefore not directly associated or buried with them. Flake fragment 24 may not therefore be deemed to be treasure.The individual identifications of artefacts 1-17 have established all to be of contemporary date, belonging to the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age and dating to between 1400 and 1275 BC. The account of discovery and follow-up archaeological investigation of the find-spot with the finder has established a probable original burial location of the hoard as a directly associated group, in the immediate vicinity of the excavated test-pit, over the detector pit from which the large torc fragment (No. 2) had been retrieved. The dirk and palstave (Nos. 15 & 17) had been found within a metre of this location, at reasonable depth, suggesting they were very close to the original hoard burial place. This location was near the crest of a plateau, while the remaining bronze artefacts had been scattered downslope to the north-north-east over a maximum distance of 43m from the test-pit. The decorated gold strip was discovered at a later date in the same field, also downslope, and approximately 55m to the north-west of the test-pit. This dispersal pattern is consistent with a disturbed hoard group and it is probable that these artefacts were once buried in direct association as a hoard. In modern times, the buried hoard was probably disturbed through ploughing or agricultural activity, with many of the artefacts being dragged in disturbed cultivated soil downslope from the original burial place.",1,"National importance","Metallurgical analysis (MD)MethodQualitative surface analysis of the objects within the hoard was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6A for 100 live seconds. Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements. These factors can affect the quantities of copper and tin, lead and zinc analysed on the surface of an object.ResultsAll numbers relate to the artefacts as described above.1. Decorated gold strip fragment - three readings indicated a composition of 78-79% gold, 17.5-18.5% silver, and 2.6-2.8% copper. This is consistent with a Middle Bronze Age gold signature and contains less copper than gold of Late Bronze Age date.2. Twisted bronze torc fragment - a leaded bronze, with small quantities of arsenic andtraces of nickel. This fragment had a different composition to the other twisted bronze torc fragments.3-8. Twisted bronze torc fragments - these all had similar compositions - a bronze with minor quantities of arsenic and traces of nickel and lead. These fragments had a different composition to twisted bronze torc fragment number 2.9-10. Decorated bronze bracelet of Liss Type (conjoining fragments) - both fragments have the same composition - a bronze with some arsenic and traces of nickel and lead - same11-12. Probable ribbed bronze bracelet fragment of Ramsgate Type - both fragments have the same composition - a leaded bronze with small quantities of nickel and arsenic.13-14. Swollen-shaft / Picardy related pin (conjoining fragments) - both fragments have the same composition - a leaded bronze with traces of nickel and arsenic.15-16. Dirk & loose rivet (Group IV dirk, with Archaic Group II Affinities) - these items both had the same composition - a bronze with negligible lead and minor amounts of arsenic plus traces of nickel.17. Palstave (Group III Low-flanged (Broad-blade) Palstave) - a bronze with minor quantities of arsenic and traces of nickel, lead, silver and antimony.18. Semi-worked bar - a lead tin alloy with traces of copper and zinc - probably modern.19. Circular flat headed rivet - a leaded bronze with zinc - probably modern.20. Flattened sheet edge - a leaded bronze with some antimony and traces of arsenic and zinc - probably modern.21. Flat lump with vesicles -a leaded bronze containing less tin with traces of arsenic and antimony, but no zinc or silver - probably modern.22. Copper alloy lump - a leaded gunmetal containing significant quantities of tin, zinc and lead with traces of arsenic and nickel, but no silver or antimony - probably modern.23. Copper alloy pot or cauldron leg - a leaded bronze with traces of zinc, arsenic, silver and antimony - Roman or later in composition, but stylistically identifiable as late Medieval to early post-Medieval in date.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-09-08T23:00:00Z,2013-12-02T00:00:00Z,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,"Restricted access","Usk area",,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (From FLO)","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales",583605,images/mlodwick/,DH007217_01.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMGW,2016-09-22T10:06:58Z,2017-12-04T15:49:45Z

The object was folded upon discovery and subsequently opened up by the finder.One edge of the strip is complete having been cut regularly with a slightly thickened rim while the other edge of the strip has been torn resulting in a sharp undulating edge. The decoration consists of eight fine, straight ridges and grooves..Dimensions:length 17mm, width 14mm, weight 2.1gDiscussion:The linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, including finds from Sherborne St John, Hampshire, The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005). Given that it is similar to strips that usually have a greater length; it is not inconceivable that the Retford find has been cut from a longer strip.It is possible that the object was once tubular, in which case it may have formed a gold bead or similar (e.g.a fitting folded around the edges of another object). Elure provides a number of French examples of such beads ('perles tubulaires lisses': 1982, 29, figs. 24-7). An example from Bern, Switzerland is twice the length of the putative Retford bead and is decorated with grooves separated by undecorated surfaces (British Museum WG 468). Undecorated cylindrical gold beads have also recently been discovered in a Chalcolithic Beaker burial from Kingsmead Quarry in Berkshire (S. Needham pers comm.).Similar examples which have been recorded on the PAS database include LVPL-34D297 2012 T926, GLO-F8F3B7 2012T382 and SF-D30D10 2011T825.Statement:The object is predominantly of precious metal and is almost certainly more than 300 years old and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of theTreasure Act (1996).",,"County / local importance",,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-09-17T23:00:00Z,2016-09-17T23:00:00Z,"West Midlands",Shropshire,Shropshire,"Restricted access","Much Wenlock",,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Donated to museum after being declared Treasure","Shropshire Museums",598508,images/voakden/,LVPL25FCB6.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,LVPL,2016-09-21T11:24:11Z,2019-12-20T12:25:32Z

BC 2500 - BC 2050The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid in shape. The butt is relatively thin having a flat edge, the butt has been broken. The patina at the break matches with the rest of the axe suggesting the break occurred in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge). However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.5 mm). The sides of the blade expand slightly to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 62.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. The blade facet has been heavily abraded and is virtually no longer visible, however the top and bottom of the blade do slope gently down to the edge. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. The object measures 86.2 mm in length. The width at the butt is 45.4 mm, the centre is 51.5 mm wide and the blade is 62.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 6.9 mm, the centre is 9.5 mm thick and the blade is 5.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 252.1 g. The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour with a much abraded or corroded patina. Traces of a light green patina, suggesting corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail. The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age (or possibly even the Copper Age). This example fits best into the copper axes and early bronze axes. The form of the axe is comparable to Type Castletown Roche/Pitlochry (outlined by Schmidt and Burgess p 22-23, Plate 1, No 5). These axes fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

It is decorated with embossed patterns and pointill&eacute; and belongs to the embossed goldwork tradition (see Needham 2000a).The object is formed from a cylindrical band of sheet metal with no joins in evidence. In cross-section it has a corrugated appearance with six bulbous concentric embossed ribs, four decorating the body and two forming the rims. One rim has been damaged and the embossed rib is only partially visible. The ribs are fairly evenly spaced, separated by flat bands. They are not of equal size: the ribs on the edges of the band are rather wider (c.7mm), than the ribs decorating the body (c.4-5mm).Each rib is flanked by an irregular row of pointill&eacute; - a pattern of impressed dots applied from the front. The pointill&eacute; decoration does not neatly follow the edge of the ribs and deviates in several places. The sheet forming the edges of the armlet have been folded over. Needham (2000b,23) suggests this may function to strengthen the overall object and, possibly grip a backing material.Condition: The armlet is distorted, likely by soil pressure, and much of one side of the armlet is damaged due to plough action suggesting pressure may have been applied above and that the armlet may have been laid to rest on its better preserved side. Both surfaces are polished, or burnished, to a crisp shine reflected in the presence of fine striations. Some more prominent marks are however, more likely a result of subsequent depositional damage. A small section of the armlet has detached from the damaged side of the armlet and survives as an undecorated crumpled square of c.10mm by 8mm. It derives from the edge of the armlet: the folded edge of gold on the inner surface is still visible.Dimensions:Circumference of the more intact rim: 258mm Diameter (assuming the armlet was approximately circular): 82.1mm (measure using thread applied to scale image); Height: 50.3mm (in crushed state); Thickness: 0.7mm; Weight: 13.85g (incomplete state).Small detached square from edge of armlet: 10mm by 8mm; Weight: 0.09gMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis was undertaken at the British Museum by Duncan Hook and indicated a surface composition of approximately 82-84% gold, 14-16% silver, and 1.5-2% copper (see appended report). This can be compared to results for the Lockington armlets (see Hook and Meeks in Needham 2000b, 27-9).Discussion:This Early Bronze Age gold embossed armlet belongs to Group 3 of Stuart Needham&#39;s armlet typology (2000b, 29-38). Group 3 armlets of gold and copper alloy are unified by the presence of multiple ribs to decorate the body of the armlet (Needham 2000b, 31; also see Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 913-14, Tradition 4: Embossed goldwork). Needham assigned 11 armlets to Group 3 and this figure has remained the same until the discovery of the Bewhome armlet, bringing the total to 12 armlets from Britain and Ireland. Among the group are four (five once we include the new find from Bewhome) made of gold with embossed ribs, two from the aforementioned site of Lockington (now in the British Museum), one from Whititeld, Co. Waterford, Ireland (now considered lost; Hughes 2000, pl. 18), and one from Cuxwold, near Caistor, Lincolnshire (also now considered to be lost; Hughes 2000, pl. 19) (see Hughes 2000, Appendix 1 for details).The Bewhome armlet is similar in several respects to two gold armlets found during the excavation of a barrow cemetery near the village of Lockington, Leicestershire: BM 1996, 0901.2 has a similar corrugated appearance to the Bewhome armlet while BM 1996, 0901.1 shares similarly applied pointill&eacute; decoration (see Hughes 2000). The Bewhome find shares several other features in common with Lockington. It was made without join and has wider ribs at the edges, serving to emphasise the rims. The diameter of the Bewhome find is also similar to Lockington:Internal diameter of Lockington armlet No. 1: 77.5 - 79mm;Internal diameter of Lockington armlet No. 2: 79 - 83mm ;Internal diameter of Bewhome armlet: c. 82mm;However, the Bewhome armlet is not as carefully decorated as the Lockington examples and is considerably lighter. Even allowing for the loss of material from the damaged rim of armlet, the Bewsholme example is substantially lighter (13.85g compared to 24.82g (Lockington armlet no. 1) and 28.16g (Lockington armlet no. 2). Needham and Sheridan (2014, 912), have noted that embossed gold armlets would likely have had organic backings (see details of the folded edges, above) and this may explain the lightness of the Bewholme find.The Whitield armlet bears more comparison to the fusiform bead-like decoration of Lockington armlet BM 1996, 0901.1. The lost armlet from Cuxwold, Lincolnshire is quite closely comparably to the new find and was found c.40-50 miles from Bewhome, separated by the River Humber. It is now lost (thus preventing closer comparison) but a woodcut published in the Archaeological Journal for 1857 (Trollope 1857, 92; May 1976, 07-101) suggests it was decorated with straight ribs decorated on either side with lines of pointill&eacute;.The key differences between Cuxfold and Bewhome are the number of ribs (seven in the case of Cuxwold, six in the case of Bewhome) and the dimensions of the Cuxfold armlet, as given in the Archaeological Journal, where the height is recorded as 3 &frac14; inches (83mm), the internal diameter (at the wider end of the tapering armlet) as 3 &frac34; (96mm) and the weight as 10 oz 5 dr 1 scr (given in Apothecary Equivalents) which can be converted to c.320g. That weight measurement is far in excess of any similar object and should be regarded with some caution.Conclusion: In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is of prehistoric date. It therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.References:May, J. 1976, Prehistoric Lincolnshire.Lincoln: History of Lincolnshire CommitteeNeedham, S. 2000a. &#39;The development of embossed goldwork in Bronze Age Europe&#39;, Antiquaries Journal, 80, 27-65Needham, S. 2000b. &#39;The Gold and Copper Metalwork&#39;, In Hughes G. 2000.

It is difficult to establish the original form of the object owing to its current condition, but it was probably a band with straight sides, the shape of the terminal cannot be distinguished. The incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, for example the finds from Hook, Hampshire (2014 T777), Tendering, Essex (2012 T577), Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age.The metal composition analysed via Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken by the Science department at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 85-86% gold, 13-14% silver, and 1% copper.

Punched dots decorated the edges of the tapered terminal end, with three circular piercings arranged 2 - 1 within the triangular terminal head. The opposing terminal is not visible but may be within the larger folded section. Measurements represent the item in its current, folded state:Section 1 (terminal): Folded nearly in half: 41.75mm long, 17.14mm at widest point, tapering to 3.8mm wide at terminal end. 1.2 grams.Section 2 (main section): Eight folds, 36.2mm long, 18.75mm wide, 3.3mm thick. 4.9 grams.Of Early Bronze Age date, and now in two pieces, this is only the fourth or fifth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chalcolithic period, c. 2400-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.The function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from &#39;near Winchester&#39; - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 908-9). Although it is smaller (in length and width) and undecorated, the &#39;near Winchester&#39; find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to a recently reported item from Stratford-Upon-Avon - 2016 T209 (WAW-FF1E9A).This findspot for this example is unknown as it was purchased from a car boot sale - it is likely that the find was made relatively locally to the car boot sale.",1,,"Declared Treasure at Oxford Coroner&#39;s Court 17th April 2018",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South East",Oxfordshire,"South Oxfordshire","Restricted access","Berinsfield CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure",,572432,images/abyard/,BERKBA8440.jpg,"Restricted info","Other chance find",,BERK,2016-06-23T10:13:40Z,2023-01-09T09:45:45Z

There were also in the same find spot 2 sherds of pottery both Roman, 1 fragment of vitrified glass one lithic implement probably a microlith. The Roman finds are invasive and therefore do not form part of the treasure case likewise the microlith is likely to be Mesolithic and residual. All were discovered together in a pit with large sub-rectangular sandstones some of which were utilised to weigh down the objects.At the bottom of the pit were three spearheads all laid out in a line with two large heavy rings adjacent to the left. One of the socketed axes was between two sandstones. Then armrings and two wrist torcs were sandwiched between two socketed axe heads underneath and was another socketed axe head on top a socketed chisel.Mixed in the soil of the deposition were a number of finds. A wood fragment was recovered measuring in length 52mm, with a width of 15mm, thicknessof 6mm and weighing 2.96g, it could relate to the hafting of one of the axes or spears. Also discovered with the deposition were two fragments of pottery one a creamy fabric with a shell temper measuring 30mm in length, 25mm in width, is 11mm thick and weighing 12.61g. The fabric is slightly soft with a powdery surface. It is an off-white colour and has a fine texture. The sherd was probably made at Mancetter, Warwickshire. Mortaria from Mancetter dates to the 2nd to 4th centuries (Tyers 1996). The sherd is slightly abraded and is only a fragment of the complete vessel. The other sherd measuring 39mm in length, 27mm in width, is 8mm thick and weighng 12.70g probably a sherd of Roman Black Burnished ware dating to the period c. AD 43 - 410. Possibly from a WA Type 20 ""dog-dish"" (Seagar-Smith 1993). The fabric is a black with a shell temper. Also discovered was a fragment of Roman vitirified glass measuring in length 20mm, width 8mm, thickness 4mm and weighing 2.0g. The glass is severely affected by extreme burning and is now vitrified. The fragment is irregularly shaped and exhibits a series of breaks. A further find of a lithic implement microlith was also discovered which is probably residual measuring in length, 11mm with a width of 4mm, thickness 2mm and weighing 0.19g. Probably a Mesolithic microlith barb of honey coloured flint dating to between c8000 amd c4000 BC. These finds are probably residual or invasive do not form part of this treasure case.Also from the field but 40m away is a palstave axe previously found in 1990 now in Lancaster City Museum. The deposition appears to have been in the side of a large burnt mound around 10m in diameter. On the other side of the canal, a socketed axe is also on the database and a palstave 200m away on the same side of the canal as the deposition.The metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).The copper alloy artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases, dating to between 1100-800BC (Needham et al 1997). It is intended to attempt to ascertain radiocarbon dates for the deposition of the hoard and undertake an investigation into the find spot.?1. Copper alloy socketed axeThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, very chipped and jagged, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in recent and ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 28mm, internal length 32mm, external width 39mm, external length 42mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).A moulded collar decorates the axe 8mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 31mm in length. The ribs are worn. The front and back faces of the axe are very slightly faceted at the socket end.Along the centre of each side of the axe is a pronounced casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 14mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.The axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125).Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).Length: 83mm, Width: 50mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 181.06g.2. Copper alloy socketed axeThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is crescentic, chipped and jagged in the centre although the rest of the blade is in good condition. The cutting edge measures 58mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.The socket has a square mouth (internal width 26mm, internal length 26mm, external width 38mm, external length 38mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).A moulded collar decorates the axe 22mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are two fluted ridges measuring 54mm in length.Along the sides of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have not been filed down and are off centre to the left. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 14mm in width and 22mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam does not run over the side loop. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.The axe closely resembles the Type Portree, variant Alford as identified by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 188-190 and Plates 75 and 76).Length: 90mm. Width: 59mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 260.64g.3. Complete copper alloy spearheadThe spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.Length: 152mm. Width: 44mm. Thickness socket: 24mm and the weight: 131.28g.4. Cast copper alloy socketed axe complete and in good condition.The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, chipped and jagged at the corners, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 25mm, internal length 28mm, external width 37mm, external length 40mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).A very worn moulded collar decorates the axe 15mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 32mm in length. The ribs are worn.Along the centre of each side of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded very narrow side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.The axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125). Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).A fragment of a pressed flower was discovered in the bottom of the socket presumably for attachment. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.Length: 86mm; the blade width is 50mm. Thickness socket: 26mm and the weight is 219.14g.5. Copper alloy socketed chisel or unlooped socketed axeThe socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 25mm, external width 28mm, external length 32mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).On the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away and are almost invisible. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.The blade is crescentic in good condition. The cutting edge measures 54mm in width and is 1.0mm thick. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (57mm wide) which appear to have been deliberately recessed.The socketed axe is unlooped, making it highly unusual and very rare. There are no comparable axes in the corpus of axes covering northern Britain by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and neither are there comparable socketed chisels in the corpus of woodworking tools in southern England by Lee (2014). However, Eogan (2000, 215-16 and Plate 111) highlights the few examples found in Ireland with one parallel with the provenance only of ""County Armagh"" being the closest (No. U15).Length: 110mm, Width: 53mm, Thickness socket: 25mm, Weight: 152.07g6.Copper alloy spearheadThe spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in fine condition with blades still sharp and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.Length: 150mm. Width: 43mm; Thickness socket: 20mm and weight 130.79g.7. Complete copper alloy axeThe socketed axe is slender and faceted in form with a collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade. The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.The socket has a sub circular mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 24mm, external width 29mm, external length 31mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).The mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the collar. Directly above the loop is a cast decorative circumferential ridge and above this on one face of the axe is a peg hole 4mm in diameter there may have been another on the other face but this area is covered with corrosion. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section.On the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (50mm wide). The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away bur is still visible on and at the base of the side loop. The cutting edge is crescent shaped edge and regular suggesting little evidence of wear / sustained use. Apart from the groove below the collar there is no evidence of other ornamentation on the axe.Inside the axe a complete pressed flower was inserted possibly a type of thistle.Length: 97mm. Width: 52mm; blade: Thickness socket: 24mm and weight 148.01g.The socketed axe can be classified as Type Meldreth (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204-211 and Plate 82). It is closely comparable to axes found singly at Knotty Ash, Lancashire (No. 1226), Newham, Northumberland (No. 1227) and Pendle Hill, Lancashire (No. 1229).8. Copper alloy penannular braceletThe bracelet has expanded oval-shaped terminals. The body is broken in one place. The surface has a green patina.There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).Diameter: 60mm. Thickness: 8mm. Terminals diameter: 9mm and weight 20.33g.9. Copper alloy penannular braceletThe penannular bracelet has two expanded oval-shaped terminals. It is in two fragments with one fragment missing that would have joined the terminal fragment to the body of the bracelet. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).Diameter: 54mm. Thickness: 4mm. Terminals length 5mm, width 2mm and weight 6.89g.10. Copper alloy spearheadThe spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 116-123 and Plates 75-77) as Group 11: Generic Type 11E Short, splayed socket.Length: 123mm. Width: 46mm; blade: Thickness socket: 23mm and weight 91.86g.11. Copper alloy annular armringThe annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. This armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).Diameter: 90mm.

Width 15mm: Thickness 6mm and the weight 2.96g.The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard, Suffolk (PAS SF-BDA986) is comparable to the to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).DiscussionWith the exception of the 2 Roman ceramic sherds, the vitrified glass and the flint microlith, which is probably of an earlier Mesolithic date, the objects listed above belong to a single deposit, dating to the Late Bronze Age (Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases c. 1100-800 BC) and, on the balance of probabilities, should be treated as a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric copper alloy. Whilst all of the individual object types have been found in northern Britain, it is the quantity and diversity of objects in the Late Bronze Age hoard from Scotforth, Lancashire makes it a distinctive and rare discovery. The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. It is however extremely rare, if not unique, to discover inserted pressed flowers. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in other hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard is comparable to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).ConclusionConsequently, these finds qualify as Treasure under the 2002 Amendment to the Treasure Act of 1996 (Category 2), which stipulates that any group of two or more metallic objects of any composition of any prehistoric date that come from the same find and found after 1 January 2003, qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act.ReferencesDavis, R. 2015.

BC 1300 - c. BC 1200The blade of the palstave is broadly rectangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex blade edge. The cutting edge has been lost and the blade has been damaged extensively. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade has a width at the blade edge of 40.5 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 5.14 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 19.7 mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 28.32 mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on the front side of the palstave, is what appears to be a tapering central faceted rib. This rib is incomplete as much of the patina has been lost. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 4.30 mm deep at the stop ridge and the flange facets are approximately 3.13 mm deep, and is an elongated U shape in plan. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 24.12 mm, the butt has a thickness of 5.84 mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. However, both faces of the axe have been severly damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. The flange facets on both sides have been severly damaged, the edges are incomplete. The palstave measures 123.3 mm in length and has a width of 31.3 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 20.1 mm and weighs 297.7 g.The palstave is a light - mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected over 75% of the surface of the axe. This corrosion seems to be relatively unstable at present and areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed. The majority of the abrasion present on the palstave is located on one face. There is an area of the original gold coloured patina on the surface on the base at the right hand side of the reverse. A similar example of this type of Palstave can be seen in Schmidt and Burgess (1981) plate 58, numbers 792 - 801, and has been identified as a Low Flanged Palstave. However it is difficult to be certain of this due to the exent of the corrosion on the surface of this object. This form and style of palstave fits into Group II or III (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981) which is dated to the Middle Bronze Age 1300-1200 BC. Other similar examples have also been recorded on the database, including HESH-D05FE3 and HESH-D98157.ReferenceSchmidt, P. K. and Burgess, C. B., 1981.

BC 1050 - c. BC 950.The blade of the palstave is sub-oval or tongue shaped in plan. The cutting edge measures 34 mm in width and is 6.7 mm thick. The blade is blunt and has been heavily damaged, no cutting edge is visible. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The object measures 27.4 mm in width and 28.4 mm thick at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge the axe has been decorated with two diagonal raised ridges or ribs, forming a triangle, with a vertical ridge in between, on one face of the object. The opposite face, shows evidence of similar decoration below the stop ridge and evidence of a raised mid rib in the centre of the axe.The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is broadly rectangular in plan and broadly triangular in profile, in section it appears as a squashed (or stunted) H shape. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 24.3 mm in width and is 5.9 mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is a broad U shape and measures 61.9 mm in length. The septum is 5.8 mm deep at the stop ridge and the sides have a depth of 3.7 mm. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. The remaining edge is rough and undulating. The side loop measures 27.8 mm in length externally and is 8.6 mm in length internally. It is oval in plan and the arms are broadly circular in section.The loop is situated with one arm level with the stop ridge and the other below. There are no visible casting seems.The object measures 134.8 mm in length, is 34.4 mm wide.It has a maximum thickness of 28.3 mm and weighs 327.9 g.The object is a mid brown to green in colour and has an uneven patina. There is evidence of bright green copper corrosion on the surface of the axehead.On the front of the object, on the right are traces of the original gold coloured patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.This object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 930, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950.

One of the terminals is bent upwards, away from the other. Both terminals are angled at c.45 degrees and it is unlikely they would abut each other. Both terminals have raised edges c.1mm thick. They are both dished to a depth of 1.7mm at the centre and retain traces of a dark brown substance (this is also evident to the outside of the widening and flared areas behind the terminals).The armlet/ bracelet measures 69.9mm long, 68.9mm in max.height and weighs 129.2g.Neil Wilkin comments that a good parallel for this is the Selsey hoard, now in the British Museum (Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory). This hoard comprises two or possibly three penannular bracelets with expanded terminals, 1926,0102.1, 1937,0505.1 and 1948,0217.1. It is most similar to the latter, over which there is some doubt of provenance.",1,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-04-22T23:00:00Z,2016-04-22T23:00:00Z,"South East",Hampshire,Winchester,"Restricted access",Soberton,,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Declared Treasure but returned to Finder as Museum unable to acquire",,567364,images/khindshamp/,HAMP5E48D1.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,HAMP,2016-05-13T15:28:29Z,2020-03-16T08:57:01Z

The bar has been twisted and probably represents twisted decoration but the twist is not regular and we cannot be entirely certain whether this was the case when worn or whether it is a later distortion prior to deposition. It seems more likely, on the balance of probability and comparison, that it was indeed twisted and later distortion has taken place. One terminal is more clearly finished and has a circular cross-section, the other term is more make-shift and probably does not represent the original terminal. Whether the object was worn as a bracelet therefore remains a moot point. Dimensions: Length: fragment 1 (the smaller): 90mm; fragment 2 (the larger): 120mmThickness of gold bar: 3mm by 4mm; Weight: fragment 1: 10.6g; fragment 2: 17.8gMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken by the British Museum?s Department of Scientific Research indicated that fragments 1 and 2 had similar surface compositions of approximately 90-91% gold, 7-9% silver and 1-2% copper. The twisted rods weigh 17.70 and 10.58 grams respectively. See full appended report for details. Discussion: These fragments belong to a Middle Bronze Age ornament, probably of the Penard phase. The fragment is similar to another example, from Gloucestershire (Treasure case 2007 T510). The discussion of that find relate equally well to this case: the penannular bracelet is of bar-twisted type characteristic dating to c. 1300-1100 BC known in Ireland and Britain. Eogan (1994, 50) classifies the form of bar bracelet as type iii. The bracelet fragment can be closely paralleled with two complete examples found at Saintjohns, Co. Kildare (Eogan, 1994, 63, fig 27B 2-3, plate XII, Taylor 1980, 9-10). Twisted gold bracelets and torcs have been found in fields in Wiltshire and throughout southwest England though they have tended to be deposited with accompanying gold objects (Roberts 2007).Conclusion: As a find of prehistoric metal comprising of precious metal (greater than 10%), this find qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996).

The colour of the gold is mid yellow. Both terminals gradually taper to a blunt point and have three small circular perforations which have been punched through from the outer face. On the reverse, the edges of the perforations have a slight burr which are splayed away from the perforation, but not flattened. The edge of the sheet is decorated with a border of fine, rounded pointille decoration at slightly irregular intervals, but occur around all the edges. A faint line can be detected in several areas (c.1.5 - 2mm from the edge of the sheet) and may have acted as a guideline for either cutting the sheet to size or (less likely) the pointille decoration rather than being a decorative feature in its own right (see technical observations from H. White, below). The perforations on both pieces and the pointille decoration have been applied to the same surface (i.e. in the same decoration).Overall the strip has been crumpled and has slight transverse creases, but when found the artefact was not folded.Technical observations (Dr. H. White, Dept of Scientific Research, British Museum): The line that runs mostly parallel to the edges is discontinuous. It was made by scoring the sheet from the back with a sharp pointed tool, in contrast to the pointill decoration which was impressed with a blunted tool. It was scored into the gold prior to the application of the pointill decoration as evidenced by the lack of deformation to the embossed dots where it passes over their centre. In the area close to the terminal of the larger fragment it occurs in between the edge of the sheet and the row of dots on the upper edge, but falls further in on the lower edge. It is not as carefully executed as the pointill decoration. It is suggested that, rather than being part of the decoration in its own right or a guideline for the pointill decoration, the line could be a rough guideline for cutting the strip to shape. Figures illustrating these points are held on file (see appended file).The broken/torn edges and surfaces of the strips were examined by optical microscopy. Surface features noted on the larger piece appear to continue uninterrupted on the smaller piece. This indicates they are two joining pieces and that there are no missing sections of strip.Dimensions: First artefact followed by the second in brackets.Length: 152.77mm (80.46mm)Width: 17.15mm (14.74mm)Thickness: 0.44mm (0.39)Weight: 5.19g (2.43g.) - combined weight of the two fragments is 7.61 gramsMetal Composition (Dr. H. White, Dept of Scientific Research, British Museum): Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of two fragments of a sheet metal strip from Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold, 5-7% silver, and 0.5 to 1% copper.Identification/Discussion: The function or what object this mount decorated is not certain but it have been used as a diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps fixed to a leather item. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham & Sheridan 2014, 908-9). Although it is smaller (in length and width) and undecorated, the 'near Winchester' find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to the band from Startford-Upon-Avon. Another close example on the PAS database (BERK-BA8440) which has tentatively been described as a form of jewellery, although it is acknowledged that these objects are not yet fully understood.2005T21 is the closest parallel to the Warwickshire example, but others include a gold strip from Co Cavan, Ireland which has rounded terminals (Taylor 1980, pl. 28 g,h, and i), but this example is decorated with insiced lines and dots.",,,"In relation to the Treasure Act (1996), the find contains a minimum of 10% gold and predates 1716.

The torc would have been manufactured from a cast bar into which four longitudinal cuts were made. These were then worked to create an X-shaped cross-section and finally the bar was twisted to create a spiral effect. Only a small portion of the original object survives. The fragment terminates in clean breaks at either end and is likely to have been cut. It has been bent into a U-shape with one terminal projecting upwards and the other bent inwards at a ninety-degree angle.Dimensions:The object measures 19.07mm in length (bent), 16.72mm in width, is 3.75mm thick and weighs 5.69g.Discussion: Gold flange twisted torcs have been dated typologically to the Taunton (c.1400-1250 BC), or more probably the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC), metalwork phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007), when twisting and flange twisting bars and ribbons of gold were common techniques in Britain (Murgia et al. forthcomingTaylor 1980). Torcs of this style are most common in southern England and East Anglia, but do occur elsewhere in Wales and central Britain (Roberts 2007). Deliberately cut fragments like this occur relatively often in hoards (e.g. the Salcombe hoard from Devon and the Fittleworth hoard from West Sussex) and occasionally as stray finds (e.g. treasure case 2011 T501).Similar examples on the database include: IOW-C0C054, BH-149F18, HAMP-C8DC02 and SF-FD97BA.Conclusion: The torc fragment appears to consist of over 10% precious metal by weight and be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Julie ShoemarkFinds Liaison Officer, Somerset (Maternity Cover)Minor edits:Neil WilkinCurator, European Bronze Age collection, The British Museum",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,"South West",Somerset,"South Somerset","Restricted access",Horton,,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (from the finder)","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Museum of Somerset",627632,images/jshoemark3/,SOMAA390A.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,SOM,2016-03-17T12:31:12Z,2019-06-17T16:49:41Z

Traditional interpretations see these as metalworkers reserves stored for later use. However, the failure to recover so many stored metal objects implies that recovery may not always have been the aim. The hoard is associated with flints and a soil sample was taken.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-08-01T00:00:00Z,2006-08-31T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","Restricted access","West Norfolk",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Norwich Castle Museum accession number NWHCM:2011.253",,,,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2016-02-24T15:19:53Z,2023-07-19T13:36:42Z

The ring has a lentoid cross section with flat terminals. The copper alloy core is visible on both sides of the ring where the gold plating has been damaged, probably post-depositionally. The gold covering is formed of a sheet of gold the same size and shape as the copper alloy core, with five or six raised gold ribs following the shape of the ring on both the top and bottom. These ribs may be soldered on to the sheet of gold, or alternatively, a small comb-like object may have been used to engrave the sheet.Dimensions: External diameter: 18.9mm; internal diameter: 10.6mm. Thickness: 2.8mm. Weight: 1.7 grams.Discussion: Gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC); they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. The distribution of lock-rings shows a North British Group, a South British group, and a French group (Eogan 1969). The suggested date for this example is Late Bronze Age c.1150-800 BC. Similar penannular rings have been reported under the Treasure Act, for example 2014 T193 (ESS-C0C162) and 2012 T832 (SUSS-C65251).References:Eogan, G. 1969.

This narrow shield shape is similar to that engraved in the stone mould (no.5) from Tremough, Cornwall, illustrated in Jones, Gossip & Quinnell, 2015, on page 95, fig.5.13, which is thought to have produced a slender socketed axe, but with a shield pattern more commonly seen on late Middle Bronze Age palstaves. A socketed axe with three converging ribs is recorded in NMGW-CD2C58 and NMGW-C9E5A3Z as part of a hoard and referred to as a South Wales (Stogursey) variant. There is also the square collar with side loop of a narrow Stogursey type socketed axe with five ribs and two fragments of a socketed axe, one of which also has five ribs on it. There are two fragments of perhaps the same sword, with the larger piece having been bent, perhaps when it was decomissioned. There is a fragment of a trapezoidal razor with half of its circular perforation for hafting remaining at one edge, like local examples from the St Michael's Mount hoard in record CORN-A8B9A0 and an individual find from St Agnes, recorded in CORN-28E916. There is also a rectangular razor with part of the circular perforation surviving at one end. There are also two conical casting jets with central sprues, and one more ovoid cast plug with a large cylindrical sprue which is stepped. There are forty-one fragments of ingots, some clearly from large plano-convex ingots.These types of tools and weaponry generally fall within the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a socketed axe with three converging ribs from Kingsbridge in Devon, on pages 41 & 95, pl.22, no.139.Pearce (1983) illustrates a socketed axe with three converging ribs from St Kew parish that is classified as a Stogursey type axe on page 412 & 570, pl.9, no.77.Report by Floor Huisman of the British Museum:Descriptive catalogue:Axes1. Incomplete socketed axe. Copper alloy. This is an incomplete socketed axe head with a flanged blade, missing its rectangular collar and part of its side loop. It has also suffered considerable damage to its cutting edge. The cutting edge is expanded and what remains of the socket mouth is rectangular in cross section. The axehead itself is triangular in cross section and decorated on the upper half of both faces with two converging lines or ribs. The lines seem to converge more on one side (with their tips almost touching) whilst they seem to be more parallel on the other side. The break edge at the collar looks jagged and the metal around it is distorted and crumpled. A cut in the metal can be seen running from the top of the axe (near the incomplete loop) to the side, across the two decorative ribs here. On the other side, at the bottom, part of the broken collar is bent down. The axehead has a brown patina with patches of green corrosion where the patina has come away and its surface is 'granular' and rough. Trimmed casting seams are present on both sides of the axe (top and bottom) and extend to the tip of the blade. On one side, remnants of soil with imprints of grass or similar vegetation can be seen. This ribbed socketed axe resembles axes of the South Wales (Stogursey) type (see below), dating to the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park phase (c. 950-850 BC).Dimensions: Length: 88 mm. Maximum width at blade: 51.5 mm. Maximum width at socket mouth (with jagged, protruding edge): 52 mm by 27.5 mm (rectangular). Remainder of loop: 6 mm (width) by 10 (length). Weight: 236.41 g.2. Fragment of a winged axe: Copper alloy. This is an incomplete winged axe with the blade end missing. Part of the butt end has also been broken off, but the distinctive wide 'H' shaped cross section is still visible. There are three wings (the fourth one was broken off with the butt end) on the top and bottom of the fragment which curve towards each other, but the ends do not touch. There is a loop on one side which seems to have been pressed down and sideways a little so that the hole has becomes tear-shaped. There appears to be a small cut in the top of the loop and another in the side of one of the wings below it. Another small cut or break is found in what remains of the fourth wing on the other side of the axe. The fragment has a greenish-brown patina and a granular or lumpy corroded surface, although the surface under the wings is a little bit smoother.Dimensions: Length: 46 mm. Maximum width across wings: 29 mm. Maximum width of body 8.5 mm. tapering to 6 and 4 mm at the broken butt and blade ends. The three remaining wings are between 5-7 mm thick. The outside of the loop measures 21 mm and the hole on the inside 8 mm in length. The maximum width of the loop is 8 mm. Weight: 79.63 g.3. Fragment of a socketed ribbed axe: Copper alloy. This is the butt end of a socketed ribbed axe with its blade missing. It has been broken off just after the loop on top of the axe. A large rectangular chunk was also taken away just below the loop on one side so that most of the face of the axe after the collar is missing, whereas part of the other face does extend beyond the butt end collar. The socket mouth, with its rim intact, is square in cross section. The fragment itself is trapezoidal in cross section and decorated with three ribs on the face that remains. These ribs seem to converge slightly, being wider at the socket moth than towards the blade. The break has left slightly jagged edges and a tear in the metal can be seen running from the edge of the break towards the loop on top of the axe. The casting seam is clearly visible on the bottom of the axe and does not seem to have been trimmed here. On the top of the axe, the casting seam is just visible on the front of the loop, but seems to have been smoothed down elsewhere. There are two small punctures or holes on either side of the axe near the rim of the socket. One of these goes through the metal, as a hole (filled with soil) can be seen on the inside of the socket. On the other side, the puncture under the rim of the socket does not seem to have gone through the metal as there is no trace of a hole on the inside of the socket. The fragment has a greenish brown patina with patches of rough granular corrosion in between smoother areas. Although the damage to this axe's blade means it cannot be typified with certainty, it is likely date to be of the South Wales (Stogursey) type dating to the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park phase (c. 950-850 BC) (see below).Dimensions: Length: 36 mm. Width (butt end) 36 mm by 34 mm (square). Width (at break without loop): 28 mm by 21 mm. Width at inside socket mouth 28.5 by 21. Loop (outside): 20 by 10 mm, (inside): 9 by 7 mm. Weight: 59.49 g.4. Fragment of a socketed ribbed axe: Copper alloy. This is a small, semi-rectangular fragment of the face of a socketed ribbed axe with three distinguishable parallel ribs on the outer surface. The fragment is flat, although it does seem slightly distorted. The fragment has a greenish brown patina with heavily corroded, lumpy edges. The inside surface is rough and granular, although a small patch of the original surface is visible in the middle of the fragment. The outside with the ribs is also corroded, though perhaps less heavily than the inside.Dimensions: Length: 30 mm. Width 21 mm. Thickness: between 3 and 3.5 mm. Weight: 7.32 g.5. Possible fragment of a socketed tool: A small, semi-rectangular and heavily corroded fragment of what may have been the side of a socketed tool, based on the relatively smooth (worked) surface on the corner of an edge. The fragment is flat, although the corner with the smoother surface is bent upwards a little and the opposite edge is very slightly rounded. The fragment has a greenish brown patina with heavily corroded, lumpy edges. One side's surface is more heavily corroded than the other.Dimensions: Length: 30 mm. Maximum width 21.5 mm. Thickness: between 3 and 5 mm. Weight: 15.58 g.Sword6. Sword blade fragment: Copper alloy. Fragment from the blade of a leaf-shaped Late Bronze Age sword. The fragment seems to come from just below the tip of the sword, is semi rectangular in shape and has a lentoid cross-section. Both cutting edges of the blade are present, although one edge has sustained damage. The edge that is still present is still fairly sharp. One, possibly two lines seem to be present along this edge, which seem to have been work hardened and neatly stepped/bevelled. The piece is slightly bent as a result of the fragmentation of this object before its deposition. It is not possible to assign the blade fragment to a particular typological grouping. The fragment has a brown patina, but a relatively smooth surface.Dimensions: Length: 45 mm. Width: max: 35 mm, min: 33mm; Thickness: max mid: 9 mm. original blade edge: c. 0.2 mm; Weight: 154.59g.Probable hog-back knives7. Fragment of a probable hog-back knife: Copper alloy. Cast blade fragment (possibly part of a razor) with part of its circular perforation for hafting remaining at one end. The fragment is semi rectangular in shape, with both ends broken off. The object is lentoid in cross-section at these breaks and thicker at the end without the perforation than at the perforated end. Two cutting edges of the blade are still present, with one of the edges quite sharp still, the other covered in corrosion. The blade is straight, but tapers slightly towards the end with the perforation. The overall condition of the object is fair, with a relatively smooth surface with a brownish patina, although there are a few patches with larger corrosive lumps. The damage to the object makes the original form of the object impossible to determine, but it may have been part of the blade of a knife that falls within the range of the hog-back knives.Dimensions: Length: 49 mm. Width: max: 41.45 mm, min: 35mm (tapered end); Thickness: max mid: 5.5 mm. original blade edge: c. 0.2 mm; Weight: 60.17. The surviving perforation on the edge measures 6 mm wide and is c. 2 mm deep. Weight: 60.15 g.8. Fragment of a probable hog-back knife: Copper alloy. Cast blade fragment (possibly a razor) with half of its circular perforation for hafting remaining at one edge. The original object was broken next to and under the perforation, leaving a trapezoidal fragment with two surviving blade edges. The object is lentoid in cross-section at the break and thicker here than towards the edges of the blade, which are bevelled. The blade is curving slightly, and seems wider at the outer edge than near the perforation, but the original form of the object is impossible to determine due to the damage. The object is has a rough and granular surface with a brownish patina and green lumps of corrosion. On one side the corrosion seems rubbed away to reveal a tiny patch of the original shiny surface. The damage to the object makes it hard to determine its shape, but it may have been part of a knife that falls within the range of the hog-back knives.Dimensions: Length: 51 mm. Width: max: 33 (towards edge), min: 29 mm (near perforation). Thickness: max mid: 7 mm. original blade edge: c. 0.2 mm; Weight: 60.17. The surviving perforation on the edge measures 5 mm wide and is c. 2 mm deep. Weight: 43.82 g.9. Fragment of a probable hog-back knife: Copper alloy. Cast blade fragment (possibly a razor) with one oval end and a straight break at the other. A flattened mid rib appears on both sides. The fragment's cutting edges survive relatively well, although the rounded edge is abraded and frayed, with some chunks missing, and one of the straight edges has been covered in corrosive lumps. The object is lentoid in cross-section but tapers towards the rounded edge, so it has a triangular cross-section when viewed from the side. The object has a greenish-brown patina with a rough and granular surface, although some patches are smoother. Although the original form of the object is impossible to determine due to the damage, it may have been part of a knife that falls within the range of the hog-back knives.Dimensions: Length: 40 mm. Width: max: 45 mm tapering towards 26 mm near the rounded edge. Thickness: max mid: 8 mm. original blade edge: c. 0.5 mm; Weight: 35.55.Casting jets and spruces10. Conical casting jet with two central sprues: Copper-alloy waste created during the casting of a bronze object. The artefact is sub-conical, with a slightly concave and very irregular upper surface. Below, the artefact tapers downwards, terminating in two short jets (sprues), which were cut away from the cast implement after the metal had solidified in the mould. The casting yet is round to oval in plan, with the two projections round and lentoid in section and square and rectangular when viewed from the side. The sprues are situated slightly off centre at the bottom of the casting jet. The upper edge of the casting jet is ragged and it curls slightly up and inwards on one side and down and outwards on the other side. The outer surface is rough and pitted with a brown patina and corrosive lumps.Dimensions: Height (without sprues): 19-21 mm. Width: (across the base) max.: 46 mm., min. 44 mm. Sprue 1 (convex): 8 by 3 mm. and 5 mm high. Sprue 2 (round): 4 by 5 mm and 4 mm high. Weight: 117.19 g.11. Conical casting jet with central sprue: Copper-alloy waste created during the casting of a bronze object. The artefact is sub-conical with a slightly concave and irregular upper surface. Below, the artefact tapers downwards, terminating in a short sprue, which was broken off from the cast implement after the metal had solidified in the mould. Both the casting jet and the projection are sub-oval in plan, with the sprue appearing rectangular in section and the jet almost bell-shaped when viewed n section. The sprue is situated in the centre at the bottom of the casting jet, which tapers quite suddenly towards the base of the sprue, creating a small step. The upper surface of the casting jet is relatively smooth with quite a sharp edge which is curling upwards slightly on one side. The outer surface of the casting jet is relatively smooth with a greenish-brown patina and corrosive lumps.Dimensions: Height (without sprue): 19-20 mm. Width: (across the base) max.: 29.5 mm., min. 22.5 mm. Sprue 1: 6 by 7.5 mm. and 5 mm. high. Weight: 45.69 g.12. Ovoid cast plug with a large cylindrical sprue: Copper alloy waste product, created during the casting of a bronze object. The object is ovoid in shape, tapering from a maximum width in the centre towards a rounded end on one side and another, more flat end opposite this. From the centre of the flat end protrudes a large cylindrical, ovoid sprue. Near the flat surface at the bottom of the casting jet there are two indents (one deeper and one shallower). The outer surface is rough and pitted with a brown patina and green corrosive lumps.Dimensions: Length (without sprue): 41.5 mm. Width: 25 mm. (max in the middle) to 16 (near the flat end). Sprue 1: 7.5 by 9 mm. and 9 mm. high. Weight: 116.80 g.Ingots13. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which seems to be formed out of two flat pieces that may have been part of plano-convex ingots of the Late Bronze Age period, given their relatively flat top and bottom. The smaller, thinner piece has an irregular shape and is stuck with its bottom to a larger, thicker semi-rectangular piece. The surface of the top and bottom of the ingot are relatively smooth, whereas the sides are irregular and course with pits, cracks and cavities. The ingot's surface is covered in a greenish-brown patina with green and dark brown patches.Dimensions: Length: 74 mm. Width: 60 mm. Height: 43 mm. Weight: 706 g.14. Fragment of a copper alloy plano-convex ingot: Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been part of a circular plano-convex ingot. This piece is part of the edge of such an ingot and has an irregular shape. It is ovoid in plan, sub- triangular in profile, and ovoid in section (with one straight edge where the ingot was broken). A chunk of the rim seems to be missing and there are cracks in outer surface near the breaks. The outer surface of the ingot is relatively smooth, but the surfaces where breaks have occurred are rough and pitted with cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. The ingot's surface is covered in a greenish-brown patina with green patches coming through.Dimensions: Length: 94 mm. Width: 49.5 mm. Height: 51.5 mm. Weight: 594 g.15. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which is probably a fragment from a circular plano-convex ingot based on the relatively flat top and bottom of this fragment and the difference in height (from 35 mm. near the centre to 25 mm. near the edge). This piece has a very irregular shape, with break surfaces on four sides. It is trapezoidal in section and irregular in plan and profile. The outer surface on the top and bottom of the ingot is relatively smooth, but the surfaces where breaks have occurred are rough and pitted with cracks also occurring. The ingot's surface is covered in a greenish-brown patina with both green and dark brown patches coming through.Dimensions: Length: 39 mm. Width: 31.5 mm. Height: 35 mm. near the centre to 25 mm. Weight: g. 204.64g.16. Fragment of a copper alloy plano-convex ingot: Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been part of a circular plano-convex ingot. This piece is part of the edge of such an ingot and has an irregular shape. It is sub-triangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section. The actual rim of the original ingot only survives in one place, with all other edges being breakage edges. The outer surface on the top and bottom of the ingot are pitted, but interspersed with smoother patches. The surfaces of the edges are rough and pitted with cavities and air bubbles. The ingot's surface is covered in a greenish-brown patina with green patches coming through.Dimensions: Length: 59 mm. Width: 57 mm. Height: 26 mm. Weight: 313 g.17. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which may be a fragment from a circular plano-convex ingot based on the relatively flat top and bottom of this fragment and the difference in height (from 27 mm. near the centre to 23 mm. near the edge). This piece has an irregular shape. It has break surfaces on all four edges, suggesting it came from the centre of the plano-convex ingot. The outer surface on the top and bottom of the ingot are rough, pitted and granulated, but not as rough as the edges. These surfaces display irregular, rough vertical lines running from the top to the bottom of the fragment as well as some small pits and cracks. One edge has a smooth, slightly rounded recess maybe left by an object melted into the ingot. The ingot's surface is covered in a greenish-brown patina with both green and dark brown patches coming through.Dimensions: Length: 72 mm. Width: 39 mm. Height: 28 mm. Weight: 315 g.18. Fragment of a copper alloy plano-convex ingot: Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been part of a circular plano-convex ingot. This piece is part of the edge of such an ingot and sub-triangular in plan and plano-convex in section. The outer surface on the top and bottom of the ingot are relatively smooth, with a few pits and cracks near the edges where the fragment was broken. The surfaces of the edges are rough and pitted with cavities and recesses. Two of these recesses seem relatively smooth and may have been left by an object melted into the ingot.

Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A relatively flat fragment of a copper alloy ingot of irregular shape. The piece is slightly thinner on one side and may be part of a plano-convex ingot. The fragment has a very flat, smooth upper surface that is trapezoidal in shape, which may be part of a flat metal object that has not completely melted into the ingot. There are three clear edges to this flat 'sheet', where the object was fragmented, with two of them being particularly sharp. The other relatively flat surface of this piece is more rough and pitted and so are its edges. On the bottom (rougher) surface, there is a round green discoloration with a thin brown line around it.

Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A big flat fragment of a copper alloy ingot of irregular shape. The piece is rectangular in section and has a relatively flat, smooth upper surface that is trapezoidal in shape. There are four clear edges to this flat 'sheet' which seems to lie on top of the rest of the ingot. Though attached to it, this flat sheet seems to be part of a flat metal object that has not completely melted into the ingot. Although relatively smooth, this flat surface does display a few smaller and larger pits and a round discolouration which glitters a little. The other relatively flat surface of this piece is a lot rougher and heavily pitted and so are its edges. The outer surface is covered in a dark green patina with patches of lighter and darker green coming through. Small patches of mineralised and semi mineralised organic material seems to be adhering to the surface of the fragment.Dimensions: Length: 55 mm. Width: 53 mm. Height: 27 mm. Weight: 362 g.48. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A relatively flat fragment of a copper alloy ingot of irregular shape. Its section is sub-triangular or plano-convex, but the fragment seems too flat to be part of a plano-convex ingot. The fragment has a smooth upper surface with only a few small pits in it. The other surface and edges are more rough and pitted. The outer surface is covered in a dark greenish-brown patina.Dimensions: Length: 39 mm. Width: 31.5 mm. Height: 11 mm. Weight: 59.46 g.49. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A relatively flat, small fragment of a copper alloy ingot of irregular shape. The piece is sub-rectangular in section and has two flat, relatively smooth surfaces, although one side does display two pits and a few cracks along the break edge. The edges of the piece are rough and pitted, showing air bubbles and cavities. One edge is smoother and on one side it almost seems sheet-like, with a rugged edge slightly folded down over a large cavity. This could very tentatively be part of a flat, folded metal object that has not completely melted into the ingot. The outer surface is covered in a dark brownish-green patina with patches of lighter and darker green coming through.Dimensions: Length: 34.5 mm. Width: 22 mm. Height: 9 mm. Weight: 24.91 g.50. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A fragment of a copper alloy ingot which is sub-rectangular in shape with a one rounded corner and plano-convex in section. It could have been part of a larger plano-convex ingot (tis piece would come from near the edge). The piece is has two relatively flat, surface, one of which is very smooth and trapezoidal in shape. There are four edges to this flat 'sheet' which seems to lie on top of the rest of the ingot. Though attached to it, this flat sheet seems to be part of a flat metal object that has not completely melted into the ingot. Although relatively smooth, this flat surface is slightly pitted. Two of the edges of the sheet-like object have very smooth patches which are different in colour to the rest of the fragment (one a lighter green, the other darker). On one edge near the bottom surface, which is also relatively flat, but rougher, a small, smooth, roundish protrusion with some space around it can be seen which could very tentatively be a rivet-like object that has not melted into the ingot properly. The surfaces of the edges of this piece are rougher than the top and bottom and display a few pits and air bubbles. The outer surface is covered in a dark green patina with patches of lighter and darker green coming through.Dimensions: Length: 44 mm. Width: 25 mm. Height: 17.5 mm. Weight: 73.29 g.51. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A flat fragment of a copper alloy ingot of irregular shape. The piece is sub-rectangular in section and has a very flat upper surface of trapezoidal shape, which may be part of a flat metal object that has not completely melted into the ingot. On one side of this sheet there is a clear edge, but the other there can also be clearly made out. There is some grit-like deposition on this surface (and some of the sides of this piece), which resembles mineralised organic material. The other relatively flat surface of this piece is a lot rougher, pitted and cracked, and so are its edges. The outer surface is covered in a dark greenish-brown patina with patches of lighter and darker green coming through.Dimensions: Length: 28 mm. Width: 22.5 mm. Height: 10 mm. Weight: 30.34 g.52. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A fragment of a copper alloy ingot of irregular shape. The piece has one relatively flat surface with two straight edges and one more rounded. There is one big pit in it and the surface is relatively rough. Yet it is clearly part of flat object that has not completely melted into the object, as it seems to lie on top of the rest of the ingot, with one of the straight edges and the rounded edge clearly visible. There are several round protrusions visible on its surface, which are probably the result of corrosion of some kind. The other sides of this piece are also very interesting. One is covered in a rough and granulated brownish deposition which includes some mineralised organic material. There also seems to be a C-shaped impression in this deposition. Another edge, or rather corner, of this piece has a light brown-yellowish patch with one round dark brown patch within it. Here too, semi-mineralised organic material seems to adhere to the fragment. The final two sides of this piece are rough and pitted, but do not display any significant features. These surfaces are covered in a dark greenish-brown patina with patches of darker green/brown coming through.Dimensions: Length: 41 mm. Width: 33 mm. Height: 27 mm. Weight: 96.73 g.53. Fragment of a copper alloy ingot: A flat, oval, disc-shaped ingot. One side is relatively smooth and dark, almost black in colour. This side display some pits and there are a few small lumps of metal adhering to it in small grit-like patches. The other surface is rougher due to more of the same grit-like deposition on its surface. It is also displays more and smaller pits than the reverse and it is lighter in colour (greenish-brown). Along the edge e of this piece there are a few brown-red corrosive lumps.Dimensions: Length: 53.5 mm. Width: 45 mm. Height: 6.5 mm.

A looped palstave from Peasedown St. John, for instance, displays three rounded lines converging in the middle in a similar way as the lines on the axe discussed here (Pearce 1983, 522, 642, plate 81, no. 703). Two hoards from Taunton, Somerset, contain several Middle Bronze Age palstaves with V decoration (two lines on the blade, parallel to the cutting edge, converging in the middle) (Inventaria Archaeologica, 7th set, Smith 1959, GB. 43, no. 26, GB.44, nos. 6 and 7).The sort of decoration is quite rare on axes; most ribbed axes in the UK are decorated with anywhere between one and eight straight or slightly diverging ribs, with far fewer showing the ribs converging to create the decorative motif seen on this axe . Socketed axes with two ribs converging in a similar way as the axe here are difficult to find, but there are a few parallels. In Scotland, two socketed axes of the Sompting type display two converging lines, though they seem straight rather than slightly rounded as on the axe discussed here (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 241, plate 101, nos. 1590 and 1591). Schmidt and Burgess (ibid., 23, plate 138, no.C7), also illustrate an axe of the Growtown/Milton type which has two converging and more rounded narrow ribs alongside a wider triangular rib in the middle. A socketed axe with three converging ribs is recorded in NMGW-CD2C58 and NMGW-C9E5A3Z as part of a hoard and referred to as a South Wales (Stogursey) variant. Knight, et al. (2015, 41 & 95, pl.22, no.139) illustrate a socketed axe with three straight converging ribs from Kingsbridge in Devon. A socketed axe found in a heap of stones in Loxton, Somerset, also has three rather than two converging ribs on both sides, but, unlike the previous examples, these come together in a point (Pearce 1983, 517, 639, plate 78, no. 678). Yet the lines are straight not rounded as they are on the axe discussed. Pearce (1983) also illustrates a similar socketed axe with three straight converging ribs from St Kew parish that is classified as a Stogursey type axe on page 412 & 570, pl. 9, no.77. This type of Late Bronze Age axe, which is characterised in part by the decoration in the form of three (often converging) ribs, show a marked concentration in the Vale of Glamorgan and the valleys of the rivers Taff and Usk, which flow into the Severn Estuary (Bell 2013, 332). They occur frequently in Ewart park hoards in south-east Wales, but also occur in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south-western and southern England (see NMGW-BA6184 for more details, examples and references). Scattered axes of this type are found most notably in Cornwall, Wessex and the Thames valley. Moreover, five stone moulds for this type occur in Cornwall, Wiltshire and the Thames valley (Bell 2013, 332). One of these moulds, from Helsbury, Cornwall, shows three lines; one straight central line and two more rounded converging lines beside it (Pearce 1983, 697, Plate 147). It seems then, that the axe discussed here is of the South Wales Stogursey type.The fragment of the centre of a winged axe (no. 2) is difficult to typify as both the blade and butt end are missing. An isolated similar central section of a winged axe, probably dating to the Late Bronze Age, was found in Suffolk (SF3749), although this had a larger part of the butt end preserved. Another, complete, looped winged axe head of characteristic of the Carp's Tongue complex (Ewart Phase) was found in Cornwall (CORN-079E42). This item is part of 'Treasure Hoard 2' and associated with other objects from Hoard 2, as well as another Late Bronze Age bronze hoard, Hoard 1, and a Bronze Age gold object found in the same area.Axe fragment no. 3 is difficult to typify due to the damage to this object, but the three slightly converging ribs suggests the fragment belongs to a narrow Stogursey type socketed axe with three ribs. The small fragment of socketed axe (no. 4) is too small to be truly diagnostic, but it is likely to belong to a ribbed socketed axe of a similar type as no. 3. The final fragment (no. 5) is heavily corroded and can only tentatively be identified as the fragment of a socketed tool. This may have been an axe, but could be another object as well.SwordThe lozenge-shaped section of the sword blade (no. 6) suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c. 950-850 BC. Similar fragments of these swords are found relatively often in the south of England (e.g. CORN-3B62D1, CORN-FE2E0D, ESS-3AED62, CORN-F4C163). A Late Bronze Age hoard from the Isle of Wight also has two small sword fragments that are similar to the one discussed here (IOW-622CD9). A Late Bronze Age fragment from Suffolk is slightly bent next to one of the breaks, just like the fragment discussed here (SF8232). This is common in fragmented swords from hoards of this date.Pearce (1983, 488, 505, 622, 632, Plates 61 and 71, nos. 490 and 606) illustrates Ewart Park phase sword fragments from Weymouth, and Bristol. Pearce (1983, 530-531, 746, Plate 88, no. 746) also describes sword fragments from a hoard from Wick Park, Stogursey, which includes 13 Stogursey socketed axes, gouges, spearheads, casting jets and fragments of (plano-convex) ingots, similar to the hoard under discussion. (Knight et al. (2015, 29, 74, Plate 1, no. 6c) illustrate a similar fragment of a sword from Tregonning Hill in Cornwall (2004T262) which is dated to the Ewart Park phase and the Late Bronze Age. It is associated with an incomplete socketed axe, other sword fragments and ingots (ibid. 29). Another Ewart Park phase sword fragment was found in a hoard from Long Bredy, Dorset, which also included a socketed spearhead and gouge (DOR-FD3CE4, DOR-DOR- FD5EF4, DOR-FD69C8) (ibid. 55, 83, Plate 10, nos. 271a-c). These were associated with a range of items including gouges, razors and spearheads (ibid. 83).Probable hog-back knivesFirst thought to be fragments of (trapezoidal) razors and a sword, these three fragments were difficult to place and identify. However, Brendan O'Connor (pers. com. 24th Mach 2017) said the following based on several pictures and the below descriptions of the fragments: ""First, I make the usual qualification that I would need to handle fragmentary objects like these to be certain of their identification. However, none of them appears to be from a triangular racloir like the Trevalga mould. I suspect they might all fall within the range of what we call hog-back knives."" Hog-back knives occur in a variety of shapes, from rectangular to vaguely triangular (Coombs & Bradshaw 1967, 183). This may explain the different shapes of the fragments below.Hog-back knives are closely associated with Carp's Tongue complex material on both sides of the Channel (Coombs & Bradshaw 1967, 183). This metalworking complex is part of the Ewart Park phase and occurs mostly in south-eastern England (cf. O'Connor 1980, 19). It is likely that the origin of the English hog-back knives is in north-west France, where similar knives are found (ibid.). Indeed, the closest parallels for the objects in the hoard under discussion come from the Vnat hoard in France discussed by Coffyn et al. (1981). On plate 23 several 'racloirs triangulares' (triangular scraping knives), both with and without perforation are illustrated (ibid. 121). Fragment number 18, of a racloir triangulare without perforation, is very similar to fragment no. 9 in the hoard under discussion. Nos. 20-31 on Plate 23, illustrating racloirs triangulares with a perforation, are very similar to fragment no. 8 in the hoard under discussion. The link with France is interesting in relation to the discussion about the sword fragment above, which may also have come from France.In Britain hog-back knives are also known from a number of hoards, including one from Stourmouth in Kent, described by Coombs & Bradshawaw (1976, 181-3). The fragment of a rectangular blade with a central projecting loop was found as part of the hoard that also includes several other knives and chisels, socketed axes and gouges, spearheads, bracelets, casting jets, and fragments of plano-convex ingots (ibid. 181-87). Coombs & Bradshaw (1976, 188-189) mention seven other hoards in which hog-back blades have been found, including ones in Essex, Kent, Norfolk and Cambridge (see O'connor 1980, 536 for a list of all these hoards). One of these hoards, the Leigh-on-sea hoard includes a triangular hog-back knife with one long straight blade and a perforation in the corner opposite this edge (Burgess 1986, 22, figure 13, no. 10). The fragment of a hog-back knife from the Minnis Bay hoard looks very similar (Worsfold 1943, also see O'Connor 1980, Fig. 61, no. 50). Wickham (1877, Plate C, no. 14), illustrates a more rectangular hog-back knife from a hoard in Kent, again with a perforation opposite a long cutting edge.In the PAS database, direct parallels for fragments nos. 7-9 are hard to find, although a few hoards contain knives of the hog-back type, including KENT-7C3863 in Kent and CORN-A8B9A0 in Cornwall. Isolated triangular hog-back knives are recorded under CORN-28E916 (Cornwall) SOMDOR-FFE225 and (DOR-7FBCE8) (Dorset). Pearce (1983, 423 & 507, Plates 16 & 111, Nos.127 & 621) also illustrates two examples and so do Knight et al. 2015, 24, 102, Plate 29, nos. 408, 42). Yet all these knives and the one in the Cornwall hoard are far more triangular in shape with a more central perforation, meaning they would have looked rather different from the knives to which the fragments discussed here belonged. A knife of a different form is the semi-circular knife with part of the circular perforation opposite a straight blade (CORN-28E916). Though different in shape than the triangular examples just discussed, this is also considered to be a hog-back knife.Similarly, parallels for the rectangular curved blade of no. 8 are hard to find. A complete, crescent-shaped bronze razor from West Dorset (SOMDOR-123F91) has a curved blade and two holes for hafting in the bottom corners, but the hole in fragment no. 7 is set a lot further away from the edge. Moreover, the angles of the blade discussed here are not 90? at the top of the blade, as it is in the Dorset example. The Dorset razor is also thinner than fragment no. 8. A similar razor with a crescent blade from Nether Compton seems to have a similar angle as no. 8, but again the holes are situated further towards the corner in this example (Knight et al. 2015, 24, 102, Plate 29, 281). The thickness of the blade of fragment no. 8 and its shape suggest that this object was originally a hog-back knife, not a razor.Two Bronze Age razor fragment of late Bronze Age date are similar to fragment no. 9 in shape, but slightly thinner. One was found in Lincolnshire (NLM-C12997). The flattened or rubbed down mid rib appearing on both sides of this fragment might hint that this object was made by trimming down a fragment of a larger and heavier blade. The other, U-shaped Late Bronze Age razor blade also comes from Lincolnshire (NLM-A84697), and was first thought to be part of a sword (like fragment no. 9). However, this object's cutting edge runs along one long edge and continues along the short straight side; whilst the other long side and the U shaped end are flattened, unlike fragment no. 9, which seems to have cutting edges along both straight sides. This, in combination with its thicker blade makes it more likely that fragment no. 9, like no. 8, belongs to a hog-back knife rather than a razor.Direct parallels for fragment no. 7, with its perforation appearing near the shorter side of the rectangle rather than centrally or near the longer end as in most hog-back knives have not been found. It is not quite certain what kind of object this may have been. Yet given the thickness of the blade, this object too, is possibly a hog-back type knife rather than a razor.Casting jetsCasting jets are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. The survival of such casting waste is relatively rare in hoards dating to earlier phases of the Bronze Age, but the inclusion of casting jet and other metal casting waste in hoards becomes more common during the Late Bronze Age (cf. Bradley 2013, 128-9). These finds are most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date and they regularly found in hoards like the one discussed here (cf. hoards section below and Treasure Case 2011 W10, PAS ID: NMGW-BA6184 for more examples).Examples of Bronze Age casting jets with one or multiple sprues that are similar to nos. 10 and 11 are: LANCUM-8A5846, SUR-412483, BH-872B71, LANCUM-E8F754, LEIC-370216, SF-7BABF5, WILT-FA4F72, ESS-E04151, ESS-DE6106, BH-4D6780, BH-ECE695, LIN-A52465, WAW-58EA04. Pearce (1983, 571, Plate 10, no. 82e) illustrates a similar casting jet with several conical sprues from a hoard from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that resemble those from the Ewart Park phase. Knight et al. (2015, 82, Plate 9, no.247f) illustrate a casting jet from Gussage All Saints in Dorset which was found with a socketed axe mouth fragment.Casting jet no. 12, with its rounded shape is of a very different form and may actually have formed in a reservoir on the outside of a mould further down the side rather than at the top, aimed at relieving the pressure and allowing air to escape wen the metal was poured in. In this case, the jet would have pointed upwards into the mould, rather than downwards like in nos. 10 and 11.IngotsLike casting bi-products, (plano-convex) ingots and ingot fragments were a frequent inclusion in hoards of Later bronze Age Ewart Park date (cf. Turner 2010, 86-7). Ingots of raw metal were transported and traded throughout Britain and Europe during the Late Bronze Age (cf. Pare 2013). They were often broken into fragments, ready to be smelted to make a range of bronze objects and seem to have functioned as a kind of currency (ibid.).The ingots in this hoard are particularly interesting, as some of them seem to contain the remains of objects that have not been melted into the ingot properly. Based on size, shape and characteristics the ingots could be grouped as follows:Larger fragments of (plano-convex) ingots (nos. 13-20, 24, 25)	Medium fragments of (plano-convex) ingots (nos. 21-23, 26, 28-30)	Smaller pellets/fragments of irregular shape (nos. 27, 31-44)	Ingots with one flat, smooth 'sheet-like' surface (nos. 45-52)	A flat, disc-shaped ingot (no. 53)Although many parallels can be found for larger and medium (plano-convex) ingots and the smaller irregularly shaped pieces (see below), ingots with partially melted objects or fragments of objects, like the ingots with the rivet-like objects or the group of smooth-surfaced ingots mentioned above seem to be rarer. These types of ingots are very important because they could tell us a lot about Bronze Age metalworking and smelting/recycling practices and they require further study.Plano-convex ingots were cast in a dish-shaped mould, and are often referred to as 'bun' ingots due to their shape. More than 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, but also from Pembrokeshire in Wales, contain such plano-convex ingots (see NMGW-BA6184 for more examples and more references).Other hoards dating from the Late Bronze Age with similar ingot fragments have been found in Cornwall. The hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710) for instance, contained ingot fragments and socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. A hoard from St. Erth contained many ingot fragments as well as a fragment of winged axe and a sword similar to the one described here. This 'Treasure Hoard 1' is associated with another Late Bronze Age bronze hoard, Hoard 2, and a BA gold object found in the same area (cf. CORN-F57FD2 et al. entries). In Kent (KENT-8D8F21), 18 plano-convex ingot fragments, of varying thickness, weight and condition were found together with four copper alloy socketed axeheads (KENT-8CF725, KENT-8D44F3, KENT-8D53D7 and KENT-8D80E4). They are part of a dispersed hoard of Late Bronze Age metalwork, probably deposited circa 1000-800 BC. In Bedfordshire an assemblage of bronze ingot fragments which is probably associated with a fragment of a Later Bronze Age socketed axe nearby (see BH-0B42E8) contains pieces range in size from 22.9mm long and 19.8mm wide, to 104.3mm long by 61.3mm wide and 32.8mm thick. Some of the larger pieces clearly originate from plano-convex ingots (BH-0B44F7). ESS-390408 describes a collection of 62 ingot fragments from Essex, many of which are of plano-convex type. ESS-3930F8 is an ingot from Essex which was also found in association with a Late Bronze Age Ewart Park phase axe (record ESS38FB62) and is considered part of a dispersed hoard. In Bromley, London, a hoard of 22 fragments of plano-convex ingots was found (LON-AC45E3). Pearce (1983, 451, 597, Plate 36, no.281t) illustrates several nearly complete plano-convex ingots from Mountbatten, Plymouth, which were found with Late Bronze Age socketed axes, gouges, chisels and knives. Pearce (ibid. 530-531) also describes the Wick Park hoard (already mentioned above), which contained many (fragmented) socketed axes, gouges, knives, sword fragments, spearheads as well as 15 casting jets, nine pieces of 'bronze cakes' and ten pieces of ingot. Knight et al. (2015, 30-31, 74, nos. 21a-k) describe a hoard from Gurlyn Farm which contained fragments of Ewart Park phase swords and socketed axes, casting debris and ingot fragments. A similar hoard with axe and sword fragments, as well as metalworking debris and ingot fragments of Late Bronze Age date was found at St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall (ibid. 34-35, CORN-A8B9A0).Isolated plano-convex ingot fragments similar to the ones found in the hoard discussed here come from Cornwall (e.g. CORN-3B10A7, CORN-F588DE, CORN-F4B411, CORN-0931DE, CORN-CFAF67, CORN-BBA3C1, CORN-BD3DD5). Yet they are also found elsewhere, including Kent, Essex and Suffolk (e.g. SUR-253F28, KENT-0B4165, KENT-585CA7, ESS-72A1B3, SF10255).Just like a few of the fragments in the hoard under consideration, CORN-3B4CCE describes an incomplete plano-convex ingot with two rivets with cavities around them that have not melted into the ingot. It also displays two cavities in the form of blades on the other side of the ingot, perhaps from the ends of chisels. No parallels were found for the ingots with the smooth, trapezoidal sides, (c. nos. 46-52) or the disc-shaped one (no. 53).Scrap hoardsBronze Age hoards are a common occurrence in the UK, particularly from the mid second-early first millennium BC (cf. Roberts 2013, 538). Several hoards with Ewart Park material have been found in the UK. Within Cornwall there are the St. Buryan and St. Michael's mount hoards already mentioned above (CORN-A8B9A0 and CORN-37D710). Elsewhere in southern England similar hoards of Later Bronze Age date with Ewart Park phase material are described under the numbers: NMGW-3EA2A8, ESS-F8865B, ESS-8822A3, KENT-757FC0, NMGW-BA6184, IOW-622CD9, 2004 T262. Like the hoard under consideration, they often include a selection of (damaged or fragmented) objects including axes, knives, spears, sword fragments, and by-products of metalworking like casting jets, moulds, crucibles, ingots and slag. Such scrap hoards become common in the Late Bronze Age (Bradley 2013, 128). They often occur near the coast, perhaps because in this way 'foreign' objects from Continental Europe could be melted down and replaced by more appropriate forms (Bradley 2013, 135). This is an interesting argument in relation to the sword fragment and axes in this hoard, some of which may be of French origin (see above).Conclusion: As a find of more than two objects of prehistoric base metal from an single find, this case qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996), Designation Order 2002Conservation report by Laura Ratcliffe-Warren on Trevean Hoard, St Levan (2016 T20) clean up before sending to the BM.Trevean Hoard, consisting of copper alloy items, all broken to some degree:41 ingot fragments, various sizes	5 axe fragments, 4 socketed, 1 winged	3 casting plugs/flashes with sprue still attached (very crisp)	2 sword blade fragments, look to be from the same sword, one a tip fragment	2 fragments of razors, hole evident on bothSurrounded by very dark organic soil in a small pit within natural rab. The organic nature of the soil which is a dark reddish-brown fine silt, immediately on and around the hoard, suggests organic material was closely associated with the metal pieces at burial. In fact the soil looks to have been largely composed of rotted organic material.Most of the items themselves have adherent soil and preserved (mineralised and semi mineralised plant material) organic remains on their surfaces. This is very similar to the preservation on and around the copper alloy components of the Late Bronze Age Mylor socketed axe hoard. Brief investigation under magnification identified the following remains:Straw/grass	Bracken	Rootlets	Possible partial textile fibre	Seeds	Insect remains	Mineralised shell fragments, most likely snail.No textiles or rotten threads can be seen but one of the larger ingots had what looks like leather remains in a cavity, suggesting a leather bag or similar may have contained the fragments at burial. The dark halo of soil immediately around the find also suggests a closely associated organic element, the bracken possibly being used as padding within the bag around the items; this appeared to be the case with the axes in the Mylor hoard also.The items were kept wet immediately upon discovery then air dried over three days before I saw them. The soil and metal seemed thoroughly dry upon inspection on 8th January, 2016.Mechanical removal of the loose soil was carried out to facilitate identification but no further fine cleaning was carried out due to time constraints. Also, as the metal was all in good condition and the surface soil easily removed with a stiff brush, I felt it was not necessary to carry out further cleaning, and the items can be clearly looked at for form as they are. There was only one piece in the hoard, the blade of the incomplete socketed axe, that appeared to have any significant degree of active corrosion. I removed the whitest of the powdery corrosion mechanically but it was not seriously extensive.I am happy that the hoard would be stable in a micro-climated box with silica gel ensuring low humidity, for the duration of its study and travels for ID. I have bagged or bottled the significant organic remains found on a few pieces and these should be kept with their originator, each fragment in its own bag within the box to avoid chafing during transport.The pieces are in remarkable good condition for the county and appear to have decent preservation of their patina layers.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-12-27T00:00:00Z,2015-12-27T00:00:00Z,"South West",Cornwall,Cornwall,"Restricted access","St Levan",,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Royal Cornwall Museum",1077373,images/atyacke/,DSCN8065.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,CORN,2016-01-07T16:10:25Z,2019-11-20T13:14:12Z

Its function is unclear; the wires could well be from the same melt as the gold sheet making it less likely that they are a repair. They could have served to fasten the sheet to something else, or to suspend it. It appears that the sheet may have been folded (and perhaps unfolded) in antiquity, causing the object stress. The composition is acceptable for a Bronze Age date but the decoration is more akin to continental goldwork of that date than British. Its attribution to the Bronze Age seems likely.

The axe is incomplete and only the cutting edge and lower blade survive, the butt and upper blade are lost due to an abraded but relatively recent break. It is very possibly that the other part is present in the field in which this was found. The condition of the axe is poor - small areas of a deep brown coloured surface patina are present but the majority has been removed by laminating corrosion. The tips of the blade and the cutting edge are also both abraded. The profile of the axe was probably lentoid and the thickness across the break is relatively slight. The colour of the break is unusual with an area of black coloured surface - possibly burnt area - and a light green corrosion product. It seems most probable that the axe was cast in an open mould. All the diagnostic elements of the axe are lost (such as shape of butt and hafting specifications). From the blade shape (which could be described as fan-like) it is probable that the axe falls into the Migdale tradition of metalworking. This fits with the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.

There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away.The length is 50 mm, the width of broken edge is 32 mm and the width of the butt end is 26.5 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 8 mm and the thickness of the butt end is 5 mm.Similar slender flat axes with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of slender Migdale type flat axes from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall and Salcombe in Devon, on pages 400 &amp; 453, plates 1 &amp; 38, nos.6 &amp; 289, and a similar fragment of a flat axe that has been chiselled at one end from Penzance, Cornwall on page 423, pl. 15, no.123, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Knight, Ormrod &amp; Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Braddock Downs in Cornwall, Bishop&#39;s Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.36, 111 &amp; 213.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

It is missing parts of the central boss and surrounding area, as well as most of the handle and small areas of the main body of the shield due to post-depositional damage. Damage to opposing sides of the rim indicate it has at one stage been partially bent or folded, although it is unclear whether this was deliberate or as a result of deposition.The shield is circular in form, hammered to create a thin disc that in places measures 0.77mm in thickness. The exterior diameter of the rim is approximately 600mm, the rim itself rolled forwards onto the front face of the shield. It has a prominent central boss that measures 112.80mm in diameter. This is conical in form with vertical sides that are decorated with double concentric grooves. A small area of the boss is missing due to old breaks, and in its current state the boss it is detached from the remainder of the shield due to post-depositional damage. Between the central boss and the rim are a series of three concentric ribs that divide the front face of the shield into four concentric bands. Each rib is semi-circular in section and has a concave back face. The outermost of the four bands is undecorated, while the three innermost bands have embossed decoration formed from multiple dome-shaped bosses. The innermost band, with a rib measuring c.240mm in diameter, preserves a total of eight hemispherical bosses with concave/hollow back faces. These are slightly unevenly positioned around the band and measure approximtely 45mm in diameter. One is separately cast and originally detachable, with solid domed head and integral rivet, measuring a slightly larger c.48mm in diameter. This holds in place on the back face a fragment of the rectangular copper-alloy handle, which is mostly missing due to old breaks. Presumably the remainder of the handle remains attached to the now missing area of the central band, although it is unclear from the proces of recovery whether any further fragments survived at the original findspot.The next concentric band has a rib measuring c.380mm in diameter. This band is decorated with 19 hemispherical bosses, again slightly unevenly distributed around the face, and of identical size and form to those of the inner band. Two opposing bosses on this band are detachable and separately cast, each with integral rivets on their back faces. One preserves the remains of a separately cast copper-alloy tab, of which one flattened terminal end with central circular aperture survives intact, the remainder now missing due to old breaks and indicated only by a stain on the back face of the shield. A second copper-alloy tab survives intact, but now separated from the opposing detachable tab. It has one flattened rectangular terminal with rounded end, flaring at the opposite end to a flattened triangular terminal with large central circular aperture set at right angles to the rounded end. The tab measures 36.92mm in length, 11.35mm in width (at perforated end, 6.55mm at rounded end), and 1.03mm in thickness (at perforated end, 3.42mm at rounded end).The outermost of the decorated bands has a rib measuring c.500mm in diameter and is decorated with a total of 29 bosses in identical fashion to the inner two bands. It has suffered from some post-depositional damage resulting in relatively large areas of the band being removed due to old breaks, and with active copper-alloy corrosion visible in places.All areas of the shield have a dark brown patina, which in the areas where there are old breaks demonstrate pale green corrosive products, particularly where the shield is thin, cracked and fragile in nature. On the front face there are traces of a paler yellow/gold (copper?) surface, particularly evident around the inner surfaces of the ribs and the bases of the bosses. It is uncertain whether this is truly decorative in nature or a result of a combination of manufacture and preservation of the object.This is an incomplete shield of Bronze Age date. Its size and form indicate it belongs to a group of shields known as Type Yetholm that appear a typically insular British type and of which 26 examples are known to date (Uckelmann, 2011: 191). Shields such as this would have been manufactured by hammering a blank into a thin sheet disc, perhaps using a wooden mould to form the concentric ribs. The circular bosses would have been added through the use of a punch, hence their uniformity in size and shape, and slightly uneven distribution around the bands. The detachable bosses on the central band would have enabled the attachment of a copper-alloy handle to the shield, with the tabs on the back of the detachable bosses probably to allow the shield to be carried on a leather strap. This example is interesting in that it has typically fewer alternating ribs and bosses than seen on other shields of Yetholm type, although Ucklemann notes (2011: 191) that examples with smaller numbers of bands are known (M. Uckelmann, pers. comm.). Chronologically, this group of shields date to the Penard or Wilburton phases of the Middle to Late Bronze Age, current research suggesting a date range of between c.1300-975 BC (Uckelmann, 2011: 192; Needham et al., 2012). This shield was recovered from waterlogged fen-edge contexts and is currently the only known example from Suffolk.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-23T23:00:00Z,,Eastern,Suffolk,"Forest Heath","Restricted access","Near Lakenheath",,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (From FLO)",,,542937,images/abrown/,Shield1.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,SF,2015-10-26T11:25:16Z,2019-11-12T14:42:33Z

This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.The flat axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid(pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, just forming a change of angle between the face of the butt and the face of the blade. Below the bevel (change of angle) the sides continue to expand. The area from the edge of the butt to the junction with the blade facet is decorated on both faces of the axe. The decoration is formed from a series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. It stops at the blade facet. The side edge of the axe have been abraded heavily and it is difficult to tell whether there is any further decoration. Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is present. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.The axe measures 98.1 mm in length, it is 30.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 78.6 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 9.2 mm, the blade is 5.7 mm thick, and at the median ridge the axe is 11.3 mm thick. It weighs 210.8 g.The axe is a mid green in colour with a highly polished patina, which has been damaged in areas. Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident on the reverse of the axe. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. On the front surface of the axe to the right and towards the blade is an area of unusual blue/green corrosion. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Some of this abrasion is modern and has cut through the patina and corrosion revealing the dull gold colour of the meatl beneath. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest bronze axes of Britain. They are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Other examples of this type of axehead have been recorded in Rhon and Needham (1998), page 125, No 57, and have been recorded on the database, including HESH-299826 and SWYOR-F748BE.",1,"County / local importance",,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"East Midlands",Derbyshire,"High Peak","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder",,537946,images/helenglenn3/,DENO4F12EB_ob_rev.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,DENO,2015-10-19T14:33:34Z,2015-10-28T10:56:41Z

It is made of three separate components: two very similar, undecorated, bent-back, &#39;trumpet&#39;-shaped, terminals affixed at either end of an exceptionally long (126.5cms, excluding the terminals) spiral twisted bar with very regular cruciform (i.e. &#39;+&#39; shaped) cross-section. The advantages of casting such an elaborate torc in three pieces is discussed by Taylor (1980, 61-2). A neat collar is positioned between each terminal and the torc bar, and these obscure the method in which they were fixed to one another, which may have been by use of &#39;solder&#39; (i.e. using a filler metal between the join, one that melts at a lower temperature than the torc body or terminals: see Murgia et al. 2014). However, scientific analysis at the British Museum by Harriet White (see below) found no affirmative evidence of variation in the gold composition along the length of the torc. This may reflect the care and skill with which they have been fixed.There is an approximate gap of c.2.25-2.5mm between the flanges and the arms/flanges having a length of c.3.3-5mm. The spiral of the bar has been created by twisting it in an anti-clockwise direction. The edges of the flanges are slightly &#39;lipped&#39; or &#39;burred&#39; and this appears to have been an intentional finish, creating a pleasing aesthetic. This is a known feature of other, similar, torcs and it has been suggested that it was created by the heavy burnishing rather than hammering of the edges (Taylor 1980, 61). More work is needed to understand the precise details of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc in particular and flange twisted gold torcs in general (but see Eogan 1967, 1994, 53-8; Taylor 1980, 60-62 &amp; in passim).The weight of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc (732g) makes it one of the heaviest of its type (i.e. bar torcs as defined by Eogan 1967) ever found in Britain and Ireland (see Ibid.), comparable to the recently discovered Corrard torc from near Belle Isle, Co. Fermanagh, Northern Ireland (c.720g, NI 12.03; Ramsey 2012; 2013). The length of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc (126.5cms, excluding the terminals) is one of the largest ever found in Britain and Ireland, again comparable to comparable to the recently discovered Corrard torc from near Belle Isle, Co. Fermanagh, Northern Ireland (Ibid.).Some recent modification, damage and scuffing to the surface of the torc results from its discovery and its uncoiling (see scientific analysis, below). As a result is not possible to be sure exactly how the torc appeared when it was deposited. Examination of the distortion on the torc (together with the finder&#39;s description) does, however, rule out a number of options: it is extremely unlikely to have been coiled in the manner of the torcs from Grunty Fen, Cambridgeshire; the two torcs from Hampton, in Cheshire; Ropley in Hampshire (Taylor 1980, 135). The torc is unlikely to have been looped twice over (i.e. to create a double stranded torc) as is the case for the twisted torcs from the Towednack hoard (Hawkes 1932).The analysis of the distortion to the torc and the &#39;loose bundle&#39; described by the finder suggests that when discovered the terminals were not in contact (i.e. together, as they are now) but may, instead, have been some distance and angle apart. Their exact position is currently being explored using 3D illustrative/reconstruction techniques at the British Museum and it is hoped that a better reconstruction of how the torc appeared when discovered will be forthcoming. Whether the appearance of the torc at the time of discovery was the same as that at the time of deposition is, however, a moot point. While there is no evidence for the torc having been struck by agricultural equipment, taphonomic causes cannot be ruled out.Dimensions: Torc body:Circumference (external): 126.5cms (excluding the terminals)Diameter through the body of the torc: c.9-10mmWidth of &#39;arms&#39; of cruciform cross-section: c.1mmSpacing between flanges: c.2.25-2.5mmApproximate length of flanges from centre of torc: c.3.3-5mmTerminals:Diameter of Terminal A (max. i.e. at end of terminal): 13.5-14mmDiameter of Terminal B (max. i.e. at end of terminal): 13.5-14mmDiameter of Terminal A (at point of recurve on bent-back terminal): 5mmDiameter of Terminal B (at point of recurve on bent-back terminal): 5mmDiameter at collar (where Terminal A joins flange twisted gold bar): 9mmDiameter at collar (where Terminal A joins flange twisted gold bar): 9mmLength of Terminal A: 108mmLength of Terminal B: 107mmTotal weight: 732.4 gScientific analysis of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc by Harriet White (full report appended):Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the torc indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-87% gold and 12-13 % silver, the rest being copper. This composition is consistent along the length of the bar and terminals.The torc is described by the finder as being &#39;loosely bundled&#39; when recovered, but has since been opened up to form one single loop. The flanges are distorted in two areas, one more severely than the other, at approximately one third and two thirds along the length of the bar. In one of these areas the edges of the flanges have been scraped to expose fresh metal across five twists, indicating this surface damage is recent. In the absence of a photographic record of the torc as-found, the positioning of the areas of distortion and damage may help inform on its orientation in burial and morphology prior to it being opened out to a single loop.Discussion: The &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc has a number of close comparanda among the four-flange twisted type variety from both Britain and Ireland. In England and Wales there are a number of examples (see Eogan 1967, 166-9), most notably the examples from Grunty, Cambridgeshire (Ibid., no. 32) and Soham, also in Cambridgeshire (Ibid., no. 33), both of which are located in relatively close proximity to the findspot of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc. In Ireland there is the aforementioned Corrard torc from Co. Fermangh and other notable Irish finds, most impressively, the two famous (albeit far more heavily decorated/elaborated) torcs from Tara, Co. Meath (see Ramsey 2012 for fuller list of Irish comparanda).The size of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc raises the question of function. In line with the vast majority of ornaments from the Middle Bronze Age, flange twisted torcs have never been found within graves (Roberts 2007). As a result, the way in which they were worn is difficult to establish beyond doubt. It has long been recognised that the diameter of flange twisted torcs vary considerably. The largest have been described as &#39;girdles&#39; or belts, while others are neck sized, yet still others are girdle/belt sized but have been coiled as if to form armlets or leglets. Ramsey (2013) has noted that the largest torcs, of which the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc is one, are too large for most modern waists. Ramsey noted that the &#39;limit normally stocked in waist size for men&#39;s trousers by UK retailersis 36 inches&#39; (Ibid.), by comparison the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc has a diameter of c.49 inches. This may suggest that the torc was designed for a very large waist or to be worn as a &#39;sash&#39; from shoulder to pelvis, or indeed for non-human use: on a statue or ceremonial animal.The functionality of coiled torcs has been questioned and it has been suggested that they were too narrow to be worn on the arm or leg, the coiling instead serving as a means of decommissioning the torcs prior to deposition (Ramsey 2012), or for concealing them more easily (Varndell 1986). The likely distortion of the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc may have served similar purposes, although questions regarding original appearance and taphonomic effects were raised above.ConclusionAs a single object of prehistoric date, comprised of more than 10% of precious metal (in this case gold), the &#39;East Cambridgeshire&#39; torc qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).BibliographyEogan G. 1967. &#39;The Associated Finds of Gold Bar Torcs&#39;, Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland 97, 129-175.Eogan G. 1994.

Another ornamental function is more likely.Narrow-ribbon ornaments from the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc hoard, Brittany, have fewer and correspondingly broader ribs/grooves. They are finer on an earring from Saint-Pre-en-Retz (Loire-Atlantique) and finer still on some Irish Bronze Age ornaments. Among the latter are examples in two important associations, from Saintjohns, Co Kildare, and Derrinboy, Co Offaly. The Derrinboy pieces have enhanced ribs along the long edges not present on the Flixton object, but they are of similar length. Good parallels are harder to find in Britain, but there is a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, excavated from a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age. Three gold grooved strips from Scottish grave finds which served as pommel mounts for Early Bronze Age daggers are crafted differently and may be less relevant.ConclusionThis object is predominantly of precious metal, is almost certainly over 300 years old and potentially of archaeological interest both locally and for broader stylistic studies.Dr S.P.

It has a leaf or flame shaped blade. The tip of the spear is complete and the left side of the blade is complete with the cutting edge in tact, the right side of the blade is mostly complete aside from a irregular shaped piece missing from two thirds of the way down the blade. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) oval shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is best described as being conical in shape. The spearhead is broken at a point above the socket, the break is jagged and the edges are abraded and patinated suggesting that the break is an old one, however the pieces detached on lifting when found. The socket is conical and tapers evenly inside the mid rib. At the base of the blade are two broadly rectangular shaped loops each with a rectangular perforation, when the two pieces of the object are together the loops are complete, they have been broken but no part is missing. The loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft, a part of which remains inside both pieces of the socket. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.The object has a maximum length of 165 mm, a maximum width of 40.0 mm.

Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.Similar basal-looped spearheads have been classified by Richard Davis (2006) and dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Davis has sub-classified these into classes / Types. This example corresponds best with his Type 6. Davis dates his Type 6 to the later Acton Park phase (1500-1300 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age the Taunton phase (1400 - 1200BC) and the early Penard phase (1250-1150BC) These phases correspond with Needham&#39;s Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).

Penannular ring (PRN 32821)Maximum external diameter (side to side) 19.5mm; maximum diameter of bar (top to bottom) 6.3-6.5mm; weight 18.75g.This is a complete and small penannular ring decorated with a silvery gold inlayed strip. The ring is of solid gold bar construction and was made of a straight, round sectioned bar, which was bent round into a penannular shape. Around the gold core, a silvery strip was inlaid in continuous spiral fashion to provide a striped colour effect, with seven stripes around each face. The silvery gold stripes are relatively wide, 1.3mm wide on the interior side and 3.0-3.5mm wide on the exterior surface. They are visible as darker areas of surface pitting, caused by the differential corrosion of the silver within this alloy. One side of the ring has been differentially worn during its life and the inset stripes of silvery gold have completely worn away, exposing continuous areas of gold. Some striations on the outer surfaces of the penannular ring were probably caused after burial and during more recent disturbance in the soil.2. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragmentMaximum surviving length 63.3mm; maximum surviving width 60.9mm; maximum thickness31.2mm; surviving weight 412.8g.Sizeable fragment of ingot with worn upper and lower surfaces and rounded worn breaks. The lower surface is convex in shape and the upper surface is relatively flat. No edge sections are apparent, but distinct thinning evident in two areas in side-section, suggesting areas approaching edges of ingot. Some interior vesicles evident along breaks. Brown patination with areas of green mottling visible.3. Small ingot / cake fragmentMaximum surviving length 39.6mm; maximum surviving width 28.7mm; maximum surviving thickness 14.8mm; surviving weight 53.0g.Small and irregularly shaped copper alloy fragment, with no clear evidence of original ingot shape. One surface is convex, the other irregular. All surfaces and breaks are worn. Patches of brown patination within overall grey green patination.4. Ingot / cake fragmentMaximum surviving length 30.2mm; maximum surviving width 29.2mm; maximum surviving thickness 14.9mm; surviving weight 37.9g.Small and irregularly shaped copper alloy fragment, with no clear evidence of original ingot shape. One surface is reasonably flat, the other irregular. All surfaces and breaks are worn. Vesicles visible in side breaks. Patches of grey green patination within overall brown patination.5. Spatulate ended tool (PAS 2013/028/001)Length 79.5mm; width of spatulate end 5.3mm; weight 25.3g.This is a square-sectioned copper alloy tool with a flat top. It tapers and thins at the opposite end, in both planes, expanding again slightly to form a spatulate shaped working end. This has a rounded, but asymmetric end profile. The tool bends in side view, from near the midpoint along its length and towards the spatulate shaped working end. Surfaces are etched with a brown patination and there are localised surface grey-green coloured corrosion patches.The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (e.g. Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).It is possible to be confident that the large ingot fragment (No. 2 above) is part of a plano-convex ingot or cake of Late Bronze Age date. Its convex underside, thinning to margins indicating an oval shape in plan view and of a size consistent with others viewed, together with the presence of interior vesicles, provide some morphological support for this identification. Moreover, metallurgical analysis has demonstrated the ingot to be of copper with a small lead component and trace antimony and arsenic presences, again consistent with other recently tested Late Bronze Age ingot discoveries from west Wales. Its worn surfaces and breaks suggest that the ingot was disturbed from its original burial context by recent farming activity, having eroded at a shallow depth (10-13cm) within a cultivated and aerated soil for some time. The same disturbed and dispersed location is likely to be true for the penannular ring, also found at shallow depth (7-8cm). However, being of gold, this artefact was not prone to erosion and corrosion in the same way.The two probable small ingot fragments (Nos. 3 & 4) are not large enough to retain diagnostic morphological features, permitting certain identification as plano-convex ingots in their own right. However, the presence of interior vesicles and very similar worn state is consistent with the larger ingot fragment, and their geographical location within the same field and less than 200m apart do tend to support their identification as probable small plano-convex ingot fragments of Late Bronze Age date. Their metallurgical composition - copper with small lead components and trace antimony and arsenic presences - is also the same as that of the large ingot fragment (No. 2), providing further supporting evidence for this interpretation. Their dispersal from each other and the penannular ring and their worn state also suggest relatively recent disturbance from the original burial context, and erosion at shallow depths (10-13cm) within a cultivated and aerated soil.Cake ingots are known in hoards of the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC), with examples from Wales found within the Guilsfield, Powys hoard (Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38). However, plano-convex ingots of copper and bronze are much more common components of Ewart Park hoards of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004b; 2008). In the light of the dating evidence for plano-convex ingots, the combined evidence suggests that the penannular ring and ingots were probably buried together as a hoard during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). In other words, both penannular rings and plano-convex ingots were being made and in circulation at this same time.The spatulate ended tool (No. 5 above; PAS (GAT) 2013/028/001) with a square-sectioned shaft, discovered and reported subsequently to the penannular ring and ingots and from the north east corner of the same field, has proven impossible, at the current time, to relate and parallel with similar artefacts of demonstrable Late Bronze Age date. Metallurgical analysis has indicated it is made of copper, with a significant presence of bismuth. While copper is potentially consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, the presence of bismuth at the levels seen is felt to be anomalous for this period, making a post-medieval date more likely. On the current balance of evidence, this artefact cannot be confidently interpreted as once a directly associated and a contemporary component of this Late Bronze Age hoard.~~The spatulate ended tool (No. 5) cannot, on the balance of the evidence available, be associated with the hoard: no close Late Bronze Age parallels can be found, while its metal composition does not match the ingots (Nos. 2-4) or the common signature of Late Bronze Age artefact signatures. Therefore, it is my opinion that this object cannot be considered as treasure.",1,"National importance","Metallurgical analysis (MD & AG)ResultsThe penannular ring had a composition of approximately 78.5% gold, 17.5% silver and 3% copper.The three ingot fragments were found to be of copper, with small lead components and trace arsenic and antimony presences. The spatulate ended tool was of copper, with a presence of bismuth detected.InterpretationThe composition of the penannular ring was consistent with comparable Middle to Late Bronze Age gold compositions, with small amounts of copper deliberately alloyed with the gold at this time to improve its colour properties. The approximately 3% of copper detected suggests it registered from within the gold and is consistent with the suggestion that the ring is of solid gold bar construction.Copper with a small lead component is a typical composition for plano-convex ingots of Late Bronze Age date and paralleled in many Late Bronze Age hoards containing an ingot component. The absence of zinc within any of the ingots provides no evidence to support a Roman or later date of manufacture.The level of bismuth registering within the spatulate ended tool is regarded as being too high for a metal of Late Bronze Age date. This composition is more characteristic of an artefact and technology of probable post-medieval date.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-05-15T23:00:00Z,,Wales,"Isle of Anglesey","Isle of Anglesey","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Oriel Ynys Mon",521622,images/mlodwick/,DH007017_01.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMGW,2015-06-16T16:34:46Z,2017-12-06T10:42:39Z

Each face of the axe is undecorated with a smooth mid green patina. Pitting is visible on one face of the blade and the patina has broken away from the cutting edge due to abrasion within the plough soil revealing light green corrosion.A direct parallel has not been found due to the incomplete condition of this piece; the narrow mid point and splayed blade are typologically late within the flat axe chronology. Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe on page 400, Plate 1, No.6, from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall, and broad Migdale type flat axes from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall and Hemyock and Kentisbeare in Devon, on pages 418, 443 & 446, Plates 12, 31 & 33, Nos.98c, 243 & 259, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.

The head of the pin is circular in plan and circular in cross section, and is complete. It has an external diameter of 27.4 mm and an internal diameter of 20.6 mm.

It has a thickness of 3.4 mm and weighs 6.4 g.The pin is a mid brown in colour, with evidence of silvering in places, mostly on the front of the pin at the proximal (closest, or head) end. It has an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement in the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.Dr Eleanor Blakelock (Birmingham Museums Trust) tested three areas on the pin using a Mistral Tabletop XRF machine. The areas tested were: a silvered area, a cleaned area that revealed silver from the surface layers, and the final area was further down the pin to assess the core metal composition. The XRF results would indicate that the pin has been silvered.Test area			Gold (Au)			Silver (Ag)			Copper (Cu)			Tin (Sn)			Zinc (Zn)			Lead (Pb)			Mercury (Hg)			Iron (Fe)		Cleaner Silvered area			0.00			53.28			20.20			0.20			3.45			1.02			0.00			21.85		Silvered area			0.00			38.51			57.86			0.32			0.00			0.21			0.00			3.09		Base of pin			0.00			0.16			82.61			0.13			0.95			4.12			0.00			12.04		Other examples of this type of pin can be seen on the Database, including SF9909, SOMDOR-839ED2, SF-81BA51, SF-54D866 and BUC-7C4708.

The fragment has an uneven break and the terminal is trumpet-shaped and undecorated. The terminal is separated from the body by a double collar. There are a number of areas of damage that appear to have to been sustained prior to deposition and which may have been the result of heating the fragment, probably in the course of breaking it down. It is concentrated on the outer facing surfaces but towards the broken end there is a section (of c.26mm length) that has lost decoration in the round and has a slightly thicker diameter (by c.1mm) than the rest of the body of the torc. A number of scratches, scuffs and striations are also visible on the surfaces.On the inner surface of the most acute bend (closest to the broken end), a 'c'-shaped impression has been made in the course of applying a hot rod-shaped instrument, probably during the process of fragmentation. The trumpet-shaped terminal has been straightened out from what was presumably the original, bent back position of torcs of this period and broad type (Eogan 1967). This action is represented by small stress fissures on what would have been the underside of the terminal.Dimensions: Length (total): 233mm; Length of terminal (to collar): 85mm; Length of body to collar: 148mm; Diameter at collar: 5mm; Diameter at terminal (max.): 7.5mm; Diameter of torc body: 4mm (max. 5mm); Weight: 57.26 gramsAnalysis of metal composition Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken by the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 75-77% gold, 16-18% silver, the rest being copper. This composition is consistent along the length.Discussion The torc cannot be defined as a bar torc (of the twisted or flange twisted variety) in the traditional sense, as it was not created by twisting the gold: a key feature of the type as defined by Eogan (1967,131-2). It belongs to a closely related but rare type that has been cast rather than twisted (M. Cahill pers comm), examples include one from Aughrim, Co. Galway (Armstrong 1933, 61, no. 76, pl. xii, 94) and two lost examples from Co. Armagh in Ireland (Eogan 1983, 28-9, no. 8, fig 5:A). It is possible that other examples have been overlooked in the past and greater attention could be paid to variation in the manufacture of these torcs.Single collars (positioned between torc terminal and body: see Taylor 1980, 61-2) are known, for example on a torc from Co. Mayo (Taylor 1980, No. 40), Friarsland, Co. Kildare (Eogan 1967, 159) and Fresn-la-Mre in Lower Normandy (Ibid., 159), but no parallel for the double collar of the fragment in question is known by the present author.Bar torcs have a distribution primarily focussed on Ireland, Wales, Southern England, and North West France (Eogan 1967; Savory 1977, 49, fig. 5). The near Grimbsby find is towards the northern edge of the core distribution. They are a feature of ornaments belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1300/1250-1150/1100 BC) (see Roberts 2007).Evidence for the melting and breaking down of Penard phase gold torcs was also noted in the case of a find from Ancaster, Lincolnshire (Treasure case 2011 T890).ConclusionAs a single object of prehistoric date with a precious metal (gold) content greater than 10%, the Grimsby torc fragment qualifies as Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).Bibliography Armstrong, E.C.R. 1933.

Two Copper Age (Chalcolithic) gold 'basket ornaments', possibly hair ornaments or ear rings, cut from thin gold sheet into an elongated oval shapes.The first ornament (Ornament 1) has a thin rectangular tang projecting from one long edge, and is now folded over back in towards the centre of the sheet. It is missing its terminal end.This ornament is damaged, missing c. 25% of the gold sheet. It is decorated on one side only with simple incised lines; two running around the outer edge of the ornament, and two sets of double lines width-ways across the middle either side of the tang. There appears to be several small punched dots arranged over two lines and restricted to the long edge opposite the tang.Ornament 2 is complete and it has suffered little damaged. Again the gold sheet is broadly oval in plan, although one end is wider than the other. Interestingly there is a short rounded tang projecting from one edge near to the wider (here the 'upper') end; it is best described as a tab that has been pierced centrally with a small sharp circular implement. The piercing has been made from the reverse (undecorated) side through to the front (decorated) side. The decoration onOrnament 2is similar to that of the first, with two or three thin incised lines running around the outer edge of the lower third of the ornament. These are not well executed and it appears that attempts were made to correct misaligning. The upper third of the ornament as five incised lines arranged horizontally across the width of the ornament. As on the first ornament, there appears to be multiple punched dots, made with a fine-tipped implement in a rough line around one side (the left side). Both ornaments have been flattened out and are crinkled both horizontally and vertically.It is possible that the Ornament 2 has been reused and reshaped. It has the same decorative style as Ornament 1 and as others known, however the tab appears to be the first example noted. The thickening of one end of Ornament 2 may actually be the central element of a typical basket ornament, but having been recut, removing the opposing end. The tang appears to have been reshaped into a tab and pierced.The object would then not function as a hair or earring ornament in the fashion assumed other examples do. Although the new function or application of Ornament 2 is unclear, it is intimately associated with Ornament 1. There are several examples of singular discoveries of basket ornaments that have been tightly folded, many often incomplete and assumed to have an altered use, possibly as beads or in the case of the Amesbury Archer's Companion,possibly adeliberate post-mortem deposition within the mouth. One example fromChalbourn on theIsle of White is missing its tang butthe foil hasbeen pierced twice near the break (IOW-B16625).This class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. These are usually associated with burials and a very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC. Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period. Whether worn on hair, ears or items of costume, they were rolled into a basket shape in use.In decoration the Whitchurch examples fall into Needham's Atlantic Group B (ii) (Needham 2011). Closely similar ornaments were found in Beaker burials at Chilbolton, Hants (Russell 1986)and Radley 4a, Oxfordshire (Kinnes 1994). They date between circa 2400-2200 BC.Ornament 1: Length of oval plate 35.90mm; length from top edge of plate to fold in tang 5mm; length of tang from fold to end 10.94mm; width of tang closest to plate 4.66mm; weight1.1 grams.Ornament 2: Length of oval plate 32.00mm; lengthoftab 3.26mm; width of tab closest to plate 3.83mm; weight 1.1 grams.",1,"National importance","These two objects were found folded inside one another, the ornament with the long tang containing the ornament with the tab. The objects were unfolded and slightly flattened by the finder, thinking it plain gold foil. The folding of the ornaments together is likely to have been a deliberate act and these may be associated with a Beaker period grave.As these objects are over 300 years old and made exclusively of gold it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the 1996 Treasure Act.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-01-09T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Hampshire,"Basingstoke and Deane","Restricted access",Whitchurch,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Donated to museum after being declared Treasure","Hampshire Cultural Trust",504323,images/abyard/,2015T72_Image.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,BERK,2015-02-02T10:42:22Z,2016-09-27T09:31:25Z

The fragment tapers towards the butt end which is rounded off and widens towards the broken edge which has been chiselled off, perhaps in order to re-use the fragment for something else. The axehead would have continued to expand into a triangular flat blade which is now missing. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now quite pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are some scratches caused by damage since deposition. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away.The length is 50 mm, the width of broken edge is 31 mm and the width of the butt end is 27 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 9 mm and the thickness of the butt end is 4 mm.Similar slender flat axes with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of slender Migdale type flat axes from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall and Salcombe in Devon, on pages 400 &amp; 453, plates 1 &amp; 38, nos.6 &amp; 289, and a similar fragment of a flat axe that has been chiselled at one end from Penzance, Cornwall on page 423, pl. 15, no.123, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Knight, Ormrod &amp; Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Braddock Downs in Cornwall, Bishop&#39;s Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.36, 111 &amp; 213.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges, and in section, at the broken butt end, it is rectangular. A large fragment of the curved blade is missing probably due to plough damage while the cutting edge is chipped and abraded. The cutting edge measures 44.80mm in width and is 2.44mm thick.The object has been cut in recent times 47.44mm above the cutting edge. The cut or break is regular with a rough surface. Each edge of the cut is olive green in colour with the centre of the cut displaying a bright greenish blue in an oval yet patchy form. The axehead measures 29.84mm in width and is 7.69mm thick at the break.Each face of the object is undecorated with a smooth greenish brown patina. Patches of pitting due to corrosion are visible around the cutting edge and long edge of the axehead.Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe on page 400, Plate 1, No.6, from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall, and broad Migdale type flat axes from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall and Hemyock and Kentisbeare in Devon, on pages 418, 443 & 446, Plates 12, 31 & 33, Nos.98c, 243 & 259, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-11-01T00:00:00Z,,"North West","Cheshire East","Cheshire East","Restricted access",Henbury,,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Returned to finder",,502331,images/voakden/,LVPL-2246C9.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,LVPL,2015-01-23T10:37:32Z,2015-02-24T12:28:24Z

Sheet pieces of gold that have been rolled to form tubular beads. At least four of the beads have small single/paired perforations (0.5 mm in diameter). All five beads contain a core of what is considered to be soil. This material has been left in place pending further scientific analysis and, therefore, at this stage no accurate weights for the gold can be given. Each bead has been cleaned to aid identification.Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of the beads indicated a very high precious metal content of gold (Dr Stuart Black, Director of Laboratories (SAGES) Reading University)Other findsCeramic Beaker (ON1526) The vessel appears to be complete, although it was found in a crushed state. Decorated with zonal patterns of impressed comb, it is of low carinated form and equates to Clarke's Northern British/Middle Rhine style (N/MR).Amber beads (including comment from Dr Alison Sheridan) ON1525, ON1529-31, and ON1557-8.Four large amber beads ranging in size from 15 mm to 25 mm were recovered from near the head of the burial. A fifth large bead and fragments of other smaller beads were recovered during analysis of the soil blocks. The larger beads are all circular in shape with flattened sides and lateral perforations. They are of an unusual type and the provisional suggestion is that they could derive from eastern England (Dr Alison Sheridan pers comm).Shale/jet beads ON1552-6A total of 56 shale/jet beads (24 complete), were recovered from the careful examination and processing of the soil samples and blocks. Unfortunately many of these beads were in a very fragile condition and have not survived. They were recorded and photographed.Worked Flint (comment from Philippa Bradley)Seven pieces of worked flint came from the grave fill. The flint comprises three flakes, a fragmentary flake, two blade-like flakes, and a retouched blade-like flake. Dating this small group is hampered by the lack of diagnostic pieces. However, a broad Neolithic to Early Bronze Age date is likely. Given the nature of the material and the lack of retouched forms, it is possible that these are redeposited finds and not intentional grave goods.",,,"The Beaker burial is without close parallel, although the character of the burial indicates that it belongs to a small group of similarly rich burials that have been discovered across Britain. These early burials belong to the Copper Age (Chalcolithic) horizon that marks the end of the Neolithic and the start of the Bronze Age (c.2400-2200 BC). Each of the five ornaments comprises a strip of thin sheet gold rolled to form a tubular 'bead'. Only small numbers of Beaker graves, both in Britain and continental Europe, contain gold ornaments and tubular beads of this sort are rare. Further examples are known in copper or bronze, but again they are far from common finds. The indications are that Kingsmead Quarry is an Early Beaker context making the ornaments some of the earliest goldwork from Britain.These items are more than 4000 years old and the gold beads are composed of more than 10% precious metal, and therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. As the other objects were found within a secure burial context alongside the gold beads they should also be considered as Treasure by association.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-10-11T23:00:00Z,,"South East","Windsor and Maidenhead","Windsor and Maidenhead","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,,images/ljellis/,,"Restricted info","Controlled archaeological investigation",,PAS,2015-01-21T15:50:59Z,2015-01-21T16:20:47Z

The less numerous types include arm and possibly ear ornaments fastening by means of a hook at each end, or a hook and eye (piercing). There are good analogues in the French Middle Bronze Age. There are also an increasing number of (often) thin gold strips and fragments with terminal piercings which on grounds of composition could fit into a Bronze Age context. Again, there are continental analogues, beginning within the Early Bronze Age sheet gold tradition.

The edge of the cylinder is decorated with two rows of impressed dots; the edges of the tang with a single line of dots. In the centre of the cylinder running lattitudinally are two, parallel, impressed grooves which form an oval. The folded tang would originally have been seated between the two grooves. However, the ornament has been squashed and the tang bent out of position, most probably due to post-depositional processes.The ornament is the pair to the one discovered by Herbert Maryon in 1935. Analysis at National Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh has indicated the ornament is made of almost pure (Alison Sheridan pers. comm.). The ornament belongs to Group Bi of Needham'sAtlantic Class of basket-shaped ornaments (Needham 2011).This class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. These are usually associated with burials and a very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC. Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period.

The style of punched &lsquo;dot&rsquo; (or pointill&eacute;) decoration is a key characteristic of primary Beaker goldwork (c.2500/2400 &ndash; 2200 BC: see Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014; Murgia et al. 2014a). This style of decoration is found on both basket earrings and flat discs of this period, including a pair of gold basket earrings from Gilmorton, Leicestershire (Treasure case: 2006 T154; Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 906-7, fig. 4b). The thickness of the sheet and the simplicity of decoration suggest it does not belong to an Early Bronze Age lunula. There is a considerable focus of Chalcolithic/primary Beaker goldwork finds in Wiltshire and Wessex, and the Wedhampton area discovery appears to fit into this pattern (Ibid., fig. 1; Murgia et al. 2014b, fig. 2). The copper and silver content of the gold is comparable to other Beaker gold ornaments analysed by Sue La Niece of the British Museum (see Table 23 in Fitzpatrick 2011).Conclusion As a find of precious metal of prehistoric date, the fragment qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).ReferencesFitzpatrick 2011.

It appears that the gold foil was wrapped around a copper core, and around this, in continuous spiral fashion a silvery gold strip was inlayed, to provide a striped colour effect. The stripes are wide, with four silvery gold inlayed stripes and five gold foil stripes evident around the ring. The terminals are flat-ended and not expanded, 1.3mm apart on the interior side and 2.7mm apart on the exterior side. Careful examination of the terminals shows the folded over gold foil, slightly detaching from the core beneath. In addition, a small piece of gold foil has also slightly detached from the interior surface, opposite the terminals. Slight compression tension lines, at right angles to the ring in plan, are evident in the surface on the interior face, suggesting that the ring may have been formed after the gold foil had been applied to a straight circular-sectioned copper rod. On one outer surface, there is an area of damage (6mm long by 3mm wide), where the gold foil and silvery gold strip are missing, revealing the exposed green copper core beneath. The surface of the silvery gold strip is noticeably more pitted than the gold foil. There are small nicks and scratches over the whole surface of the ring.",1,"Regional importance","Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8 ). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Elure 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). This is the sixth known example from Wales, with examples known from Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality did not reveal any known archaeological sites or contemporary artefacts finds within the field where the find was made. However, an Early Bronze Age cemetery is known at Somerset Farm Northwest, a few hundred metres from the find spot (PRN Nos. 00412s; 00413s; 03824s). An undated, but probably Medieval to post-Medieval holy well with two foci (PRN Nos. 03720s; 03721s) and linked to a watercourse and nearby Medieval chapel (PRN 00422s) is also known within a few hundred metres of the find. An undated burial is also known to have been found in the vicinity of the chapel in 1861 (PRN No. 00414s). While not directly contemporary with the penannular ring, an earlier burial focus could possibly have influenced the location of this find and burial context. Though the holy well is much later in date, the spring head and watercourse could also have been a significant landscape location during the Middle to Late Bronze Age.ReferencesBritish Museum (2009) Portable Antiquities and Treasure Annual Report 2007, London: British Museum.DCMS (2002) The Treasure Act, Code of Practice (Revised) England & Wales, London: Department for Culture, Media and Sport.DCMS (2007) Treasure Annual Report 2004, London: Department for Culture Media and Sport.DCMS (2008) Treasure Annual Report 2005/6, London: Department for Culture Media and Sport.Dunne, C.M.

As the ornaments were deposited in a 'nested' fashion, most are covered and obscured by others and set C has a central plug of soil. It was therefore not possible to record all measurements and descriptions. However, it is apparent from the way in which the ornaments nest on top of one another that ornaments of similar size, form and decoration have been grouped together within the respective sets.Set A [Bracelets A.1-2] Set A consists of two gold ornaments that have been deposited with one wrapped directly over the other. The form and decoration of both appears to be the same but the outer bracelet (A.1) is visible only from the exterior while the inner ornament (A.2) is visible only from the interior. The ornaments cannot be detached at present and are discussed together in the following description (unless otherwise stated).Form Both ornaments are straight sided, coming to rounded terminals which turn in towards more rounded terminals, c.30mm from either end, from which narrow fastening hooks project. On one side of both ornaments the fastening hook is aligned horizontally in the direction of the bracelet while on the opposite side the hook faces inwards towards the centre of the bracelets.The top and bottom edges of the bracelets have been folded over to give the bracelet a '[' -profile, with each edge c.2mm in width. From the angle of the impressions that forms the top and bottom rows of the decorative register, it is apparent that the edges have been folded over after decoration was applied (to the top and bottom of the decorative register at least: Nos. 1-2, below), and have served (intentionally or otherwise) as guide lines for the folds. The fastening 'hooks' have been fashioned by folding over thin 'rod' like terminals.DecorationBoth ornaments have been decorated with a pattern of impressed dots applied from both front and back and raised embossed areas with 'C'-shaped profiles, possibly produced using a former (e.g. of wood). From variations in direction of the rows of applied decoration, it appears as if a 'comb'-like tool was used to apply the 'dot' decoration, rather than a single point.Taken across the centre of the bracelet the decorative register is as follows:Five rows of punched 'dot' decoration in the following sequence from the edge towards the centre of the bracelet: i. applied from front; ii. applied from back; iii. applied from front; iv. applied from back; v. applied from front.	Embossed area with 'C'-shaped profile coming to 'U' shaped terminals.	Five rows of punched decoration: i. applied from front; ii. applied from back; iii. applied from front; iv. applied from back; v. applied from front.	Embossed area with 'C'-shaped profile coming to 'U' shaped terminals.	Continuation of the band of five rows described in No. 1, thus following the same sequence: i. applied from front; ii. applied from back; iii. applied from front; iv. applied from back; v. applied from front.ConditionApproximately 50% of the circumference of the bracelets have been crumpled and distorted. The damaged side of both bracelets carries multiple bends and two tears puncture the goldwork, concentrated around the axis between the crumpled and uncrumpled surfaces. A black discolouration is visible on some surfaces of both bracelets. On the better preserved end of the inner bracelet (A.2) there is a narrow tear of 6-7mm length and c.1mm wide.Deposition As there is no distortion to either set of terminal hooks, it is unlikely that they were fastened when the distortion to one end of the bracelets took place.DimensionsCircumference: Approx. 138mm (distorted and crumpled)Width: c.23-24mm (maximum) tapering to more rounded forms (c.30mm from the hooked terminals). The (max.) width in the middle of the bracelets is therefore consistent for c. 80mm of the circumference. The rod forming the hooked terminals has a width that narrows from c.4mm to 1.1mm.Weight: 20.6g (combined weight of both bracelets A.1 and A.2.Set B [Ornaments B.1-4]Set B consists of four ornaments, deposited with each wrapped directly over the other. The form and decoration of both appears to be similar but the outermost ornament (B.1) is visible only from the exterior while the innermost ornament of the set (B.4) is visible only from the interior. The ornaments cannot be detached at present and reddish brown soil is sandwiched between ornaments B.2 and B.3 and between B.3 and B.4. The ornaments are discussed together in the following description (unless otherwise stated). Lightly twisted gold thread or wire has also been looped seven times around the outer bracelet (B.1).Form The top and bottom of the ornaments have been folded over internally to create less sharp and more rounded edges to the sheet. In some areas the fold has a relatively irregular edge and has obscured the decoration visible on the inside of the ornaments. The folded edges do not take on the impressed decoration, suggesting that the folding of the decoration may have occurred after the decoration of the surfaces. This is particularly clear on B.4.If unravelled, the profile of the bracelets would be elliptical (unlike Set A which has a length along which the width remains consistent, but like Set C). The form of the embossed decoration is discussed below.The fastening 'hooks' have been fashioned by folding over thin 'rod' like terminals. Only one set of the terminals is currently fastened (those of B.2) the others are unfastened and are a short distance apart in the case of the outer ornaments (B.1) or overlap because placed within the restricted space of B.2 (B.3 and B.4). It appears that the terminal hooks faced different directions (as was the case for set A): one set running along the same plane as the ornament and the other facing into the centre of the ornament. When nesting the ornaments the terminals two were positioned with their horizontal/inward facing terminals in one position and two were arranged in an inverse fashion.ConditionA black discolouration is visible on some of the exposed surfaces of the ornaments. The outer ornament (B.1) has several dents and depressions, including one of 24mm by 4mm and one of 9mm by 5mm, with most of the damage occurring on the central 'C'-shaped embossed area (No. 4 in the above register).DepositionIt is apparent from the relationship of the terminals of the four ornaments (see above), that not all are in their original form: the outer set (B.1) cannot fasten over the top of B.2 and is therefore over extended while the inner ornaments (B.3 and B.4) are under extended as a result of being placed within B.2. Ornament B.2 is therefore the only ornament at its natural extension.DecorationThe bracelets have the following decorative register:A narrow 'U' shaped 'furrow' into which dot decoration has been applied. It has clearly demarcated edges. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 7.	A second 'U' shaped 'furrow' into which dot decoration has not been applied. It has clearly demarcated edges. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 6.	A third U' shaped furrow into which dot decoration has been applied. At the centre facing edge the gold rises to an embossed form and it is not demarcated on this side. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 5.	Embossed area with 'C'-shaped profile coming to 'V' shaped terminals.	Mirrors decoration of entry No. 3. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 3.	Mirrors decoration (including the lack of dot impressions) of entry No. 2. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 2.	Mirrors decoration of entry No. 1. Comes to a 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 1.Dimensions Circumference of B.1: 122mm (but terminals are 8-9mm from one another and therefore from being closed) - original circumference likely to be c.113mm.Circumference of B.2: c.113mm (terminal hooks are locked in place).Circumference of B.3: c.110mm (terminal hooks are overlapping) - original circumference likely to be c.113mmCircumference of B.4: c.100mm (terminal hooks are overlapping) - original circumference likely to be c.113mmDiameter of B.1: 42mm by 40mmDiameter of B.2: 39mm by 35mmDiameter of B.3: 34mm by 34mmDiameter of B.4: 30mm by 32mmWidth: Maximum width of 23mm narrowing immediately towards the terminals.Weight: 23.7g (combined weight of bracelets B.1-4 (and loosely twisted gold thread), as they cannot be detached).Twisted gold 'thread' wrapped around ornament B.1 Lightly twisted gold 'thread' has been wrapped seven times around B.1 only, just off-centre (c.5mm from the mid-point of the ornament). A small section of c.40-50mm was found loose between B.1 and B.2 and was removed and bagged separately.DimensionsWidth of thread: 0.65mm(All other dimensions not possible as they were obscured from view).Set C [Ornaments C.1 & C.2] Set C consists of two ornaments, deposited with each wrapped directly over the other. The form and decoration of both appears to be similar but the outermost ornament (C.1) is visible only from the exterior while the innermost ornament of the set (C.2) is entirely obscured by a fill of reddish brown soil. The ornaments cannot be detached at present and are discussed together in the following description (unless otherwise stated).Form As with 'Set B', the top and bottom of C.1 and C.2 have been folded over internally to create less sharp and more rounded edges to the sheet.If unravelled, the profile of the bracelets would be elliptical (unlike Set A which has a length along which the width remains consistent, but like Set B). The form of the embossed decoration is discussed below.One side of both C.1 and C.2 has been broken or cut and there is no terminal present. This is likely to have involved removing two to three centimetres (including the fastening hooks). Due to lack of room within the circumference of C.1, the terminal of the inner ornament (C.2) underlaps the broken terminal and the suspected second fastening hook is obscured by the central plug of soil in which it is likely to be embedded.In the middle of the broken edge of ornament C.1 (c.2.3mm from the edge) is a small perforation (c.2 by 1.5mm in diameter). It is possible that this was used to receive the remaining hooked terminal as a modification designed to make the ornaments smaller. It is not possible to see a similar perforation on ornament C.2 although it is partially obscured by C.1 and by soil. As a result caution is needed in identifying the perforation as an intentional feature and it is unlikely to have supported the stresses placed on a fastening terminal without tearing or enlarging the hole (neither of which are visibly under a hand lens) if used repeatedly. The one visible terminal 'hook' has been fashioned by folding over thin 'rod'-like terminals.Condition One edge has been pushed inwards along a length of c.17mm and has a c.3-4mm, causing a small tear to the edge through the first 'U' shaped embossed furrow. As noted above, one end of each terminal has been broken off.Deposition Deposited as a nested pair, one end of both ornaments has been cut either to make the circumference of the ornaments smaller or to render them unusable prior to deposition.DecorationThe ornaments have a decorative register that is identical to 'set B', with the exception of the broken terminal which renders the decoration asymmetrical.A narrow 'U' shaped 'furrow' into which dot decoration has been applied. It has clearly demarcated edges. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 7 at one end of the bracelet but is terminated by the break/tear at the other end.	A second 'U' shaped 'furrow' into which dot decoration has not been applied. It has clearly demarcated edges. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 6 at one end of the bracelet but is terminated by the break/tear at the other end.	A third U' shaped furrow into which dot decoration has been applied. At the centre facing edge the gold rises to an embossed form and it is not demarcated on this side. Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 5 at one end of the bracelet but is terminated by the break/tear at the other end.

Comes to 'V' shaped terminal in contact with No. 2 at one end of the bracelet but is terminated by the break/tear at the other end.Dimensions Diameter of C.1: 38.5mm by 38.1mm, not possible to measure C.2 as it is obscured by soil.Circumference of C.1: 119mm (with broken/cut terminal), not possible to measure C.2 as it is obscured by soil.Weight: 46.6gGold composition of ornament [Sets A, B & C]Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a group of eight ornaments was undertaken by Sue La Niece at the British Museum. It indicated a surface composition for seven of them (one was inaccessible inside the soil block) of approximately 84-88% gold, 12-15% silver with approximately 1% copper. The full report is appended.Pottery from Evaluation excavations on the 15th of November 2013 15 sherds of pottery with a total weight of 47g were recovered during the rapid archaeological evaluation. These were examined by Frances Raymond who noted that they were moderately abraded and derived from a single Bronze Age vessel. The dating of the vessel is open to interpretation. Frances Raymond notes that:'The profile, decoration and fabric are consistent with the biconical forms of the later early Bronze Age and are also reminiscent of some of the smaller accessory vessels from middle Bronze Age funerary contexts. It is equally possible that the rim is from a late Bronze Age straight or convex-sided jar of the type represented in early Plain Ware assemblages of the twelfth to eleventh centuries cal BC.'The report on the pottery is appended, courtesy of F. Raymond.Copper alloy awl of probable Bronze Age date A copper alloy awl was found close to the findspot of the gold ornaments found on the 9th of November 2013. From its form it appears to be Bronze Age, although dating remains difficult to establish for this type of Bronze Age object. Given the proximity of the find to the goldwork it may be feasible to assume a Bronze Age date. The tang is curved and oval in plan while the awl shaft is sub-rectangular and broken at the end.Dimensions: Length: 60mm; Width (max.): 9.5mm; Thickness (max.): 7mm; Thickness (max.) at point of break in shaft: 3mm by 3.5mm; Weight: 11.9gNon-associated finds from the Evaluation excavations on the 15th of November 2013The evaluation excavations of the 15th November 2013 also produced a number of non-associated finds that are retained within the archive of the archaeological work. This includes four sherds of non-prehistoric pottery (total weight: 5.5g) and four pieces of unworked (natural) flint from topsoil contexts (6.3g).Discussion The ornaments share features in common with goldwork of probable Middle Bronze Age date, including the substantially larger Capel Isaf (Dyfed, Wales) armlets (Savory 1977), the embossed and punched gold braclet fragment from Mountfield (British Museum: 1863,1212.2) and two small interlocked gold 'rings' found at Binstead (West Sussex) (Varndell 1998-9, 10-11, fig. 3). The composition of the goldwork (by XRF analysis) and the possible association of the ornaments with pottery of Middle or Late Bronze Age date do not contradict this dating.Several (especially Set B) appear too small to have been worn as bracelets by an adult and may instead have been intended for a child or infant. It is possible that they served other functions (as earrings or hair fittings) but their form and hooked fastenings would seem to suggest that they served as bracelets.On the balance of probability it appears that all eight ornaments were deposited together and can be considered a single find. More research is needed into their typology and into the function they served.The discovery of a copper alloy awl of Bronze Age date close to the discovery site of the ornaments raises the possibility that this also belonged to the hoard deposit. As the dating of awls remains vague it appears prudent to include the awl as part of the same find as the ornaments. Future research may choose to be more cautious with the association of ornaments and awl but it may be prudent at the current time to be open to the possibility given the spatial proximity and chronology of the finds.Conclusion The eight gold ornaments, the associated assemblage of prehistoric pottery and copper alloy awl from Woolaston qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) as they are more than 300 years old and have a metallic content of more than 10 per cent (by weight) of precious metal. In the case of the pottery and copper alloy awl, these appear (on the balance of probabilities) to form part of the same find as the ornaments and therefore to qualify as Treasure by their association with the goldwork.Bibliography Hoyle, J. 2013, Report on a rapid archaeological evaluation of land at Keynsham Lane, Woolaston, Gloustershire, 15th November 2013, Unpublished report for Gloucestershire County Council.Savory, H. 1977, 'A New Hoard of Bronze Age Gold Ornaments', Archaeologia Atlantica, 1977 (Vol. 2).Varndell 1998-9, 'Binstead, West Sussex: Two Bronze Age gold rings linked together', Treasure Annual Report 1998-1999, DCMS, 10-11.Author Neil Wilkin,Curator of European Bronze Age collection,The British MuseumWith information and help from: Kurt Adams (Find Liaison Officer for Gloucestershire and Avon), Frances Raymond, Jon Hoyle of Gloucestershire County Council Archaeology Service, Tim Youngs of GeoArch and Professor Niall Sharples of the University of Cardiff.9th April 2014",1,"National importance",,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-11-09T00:00:00Z,,"South West",Gloucestershire,"Forest of Dean","Restricted access",Woolaston,,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","The British Museum",476163,images/kadams/,2013T805group.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,GLO,2014-07-10T15:10:09Z,2016-06-09T10:44:14Z

The finds comprised of: two joining fragments of gold sheet, two cast copper alloy rings and two fragments of copper-alloy casting residue/ingot (one of which is possibly a casting jet or casting residue).Description1-2. Two,small, joining fragments of curved gold sheet, undecorated; incomplete. Roughly triangular in shape with the short sides terminating in breaks and the long sides being folded over as if having capped a triangular object.Larger piece:Weight: 0.20g; Length: 18.5mm; Width: 12.5mm; Width (where it joins with smaller piece): 9.1mm;Smaller piece:Weight: 0.11; Length: 12mm; Width: 4mm; Width (where it joins with larger piece): 9.1mm [NB. Total weight: 0.31g]Cast copper alloy ring; complete. Possible signs of wear on the inside of the ring. The original surface of the ring is well preserved for approximately 50% of the surface area, the rest of the ring is affected by light green corrosion. The thickness of the ring varies slightly from one side to the other.Weight: 8.38g; Diameter (external): 20mm; Diameter (internal): 9mm; Thickness: 6mm (max.); 5mm (min.)Cast copper alloy ring; complete. Larger and thinner than (3.) and the original, dark brown surface patina is well preserved although there are some patches where it has peeled away. The thickness of the ring varies from one side to the other.Weight: 6.36g; Diameter (external): 27mm; Diameter (internal): 19mm; Thickness: 5mm (max.); 3mm (min.)Copper alloy cake/ingot fragment or casting jet/residue.Lozengiform cross-section.Weight: 8.82g; Length: 23.9mm; Width: 19mm; Thickness: 7.2mm.Copper alloy cake/ingot fragment.Weight: 37.47g; Length: 30.9mm; Width: 22mm; Thickness: 19mm.DiscussionCast copper alloy rings are not exclusive to the Late Bronze Age but they are a feature hoards dating to this period (e.g. Heathery Burn Cave: Britton & Longworth 1968, GB 55 10 (2), nos. 29-39; Thenford Hill Farm hoard, Northants: Hawkes and Smith 1955, GB 12 3(3), nos. 8-9). In the case of the larger cast copper-alloy ring (No. 4), one side is thinner than the other, possibly due to one-sided wear, a feature of other Bronze Age and Iron Age cast rings (Hawkes and Smith 1955, GB 12 3(3), nos. 8-9). The smaller of the two rings (No. 3) is very similar to a ring previously discovered at the same location (2005 T299, Catalogue No. 2), and has a similar diameter, thickness, weight and surface condition. Both rings also have a slight difference in thickness from one side of the ring to another.Metalworking debris (Nos. 5-6), including casting jets and waste/ingot material, is also a feature of Late Bronze Age hoards (e.g.Petters Sports Field, Egham, Surrey: Needham 1990, 68-72).The two joining fragments of gold sheet (Nos. 1-2) have a small fold alongside their two long edges which suggests that they were used as a cover for another object. Scientific analysis byDepartment of Conservation and Scientific Research at The British Museum (File No. 7506-33 to 38) indicated that the gold sheet did not have the same composition as the gold objects from two previous Treasure cases from the same location (2005 T299, catalogue no. 3& 2006 T562: McDonald 2006; McLean 2007), which are likely to originally have been joined. The fragmentsare, however,likely to be of prehistoric date based on the context of the find.In summary, the combination of cast copper alloy rings and metalworking debris among the six object discovered suggests that the objects that comprise the find date to the Late Bronze Age or Iron Age. The similarity between one of the cast copper alloy rings (No. 3) and a ring from previous case 2005 T299, suggests that it should be treated as an addendum to cases 2005 T299& 2006 T562.ConclusionThe four copper-alloy objects and gold sheet fragments are likely to be part of the same findand as an addendum to cases 2005 T299& 2006 T562. They therefore qualify as Treasure as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage of two or more objects under the stipulations of the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002in their own right and as part of a larger find.Furthermore, the gold sheet fragments contain a minimum of 10% precious metal and are more than 300 years old and therefore qualify as Treasure in their own right under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges, and in section, at the broken butt end, it is rectangular. The blade is flaring to the edge and the blade facet is bevelled from hammering. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged. The broken edge would have continued to taper towards the butt end. The blade edge is uneven with perpendicular nicks across the edge which show that it was used in antiquity. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, and the surface is not very corroded or pitted, with a few marks and strikes such as a linear shallow groove on one side, caused by damage prior to deposition (Laura Ratcliffe pers comm). There is also a circular depression that has been caused by a gas bubble forming when the axe was cast.The length is 64 mm, the width of broken end is 39 mm and the width of the blade is 66 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 9.5 mm and the thickness of the blade edge is 4 mm.Similar flat axes on the database can be seen in DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-3324F7, LANCUM-6507C2 and LVPL-851560.Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe on page 400, Plate 1, No.6, from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall, and broad Migdale type flat axes from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall and Hemyock and Kentisbeare in Devon, on pages 418, 443 & 446, Plates 12, 31 & 33, Nos.98c, 243 & 259, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

The largest part (rrepresenting around three quarters of the whole)&nbsp;and the first to be found is&nbsp;torn and bent at the break and there is some damage and denting along the edge and at the widest point. On the larger piece, the surviving expanded terminal is sub-angular with rounded corners and a pronounced mid-rib. It is set at right angles to the plane of the body. The body of the crescent is wide and tapers to the remaining terminal. The central body is undecorated apart a triple stranded framing band along both edges. The lines continue to the apex of the remaining horn of the crescent, increasing to four lines on the inner edge for a short distance (possibly a slip in the engraving). The lines on the inner edge remain equidistant and curve around below the neck of the terminal. The lines around the outer edge start to converge and terminate at the edge.The remaining horn of the crescent is decorated with incised geometric patterns of a type commonly seen on lunulae. At the apex of the horn is an area of fine incised cross-hatching forming an open lattice. The lines here are slightly finer than in other areas of decoration. The cross hatching (x) is bordered by a series of five transverse lines (-), roughly parallel, below which are three downward triangles (v) infilled with transverse lines, a plain area (p) and a group of upward pointing triangles (?), similarly in-filled. The pattern of spaces and triangles separated by transverse lines is repeated four further times but with variation in the numbers of transverse lines and an increase in the number of triangles. The decoration is as follows:x-vp?-vp?-vp?-vp?-v.The variations in triangles and lines are:x- (5)v(3)p?(3)-(5)v(3)p?(4)-(4)v(4)p?(4)-(3)v(4)p?(4)-(4)v(5).It is likely that the decoration was repeated on the damage horn.The line thicknesses vary through the decoration.

The ribbon is only 2 mm thick, and if unfolded would be semi-circular in plan with one edge deliberately and symmetrically rounded and the other edge straight. The straight edge seems not to have been sheared off from something longer, but instead has been evenly and neatly cut to create the size that was needed. The maker has used a sharp chisel or a tool like a modern chasing punch to create about twenty-six fine longitudinal grooves which have been essentially 'chased on' to the strip of gold by hand, shown by the overlapping parallel lines of tooling (Martin Page pers comm).The manufacturing technique is consistent with a Bronze Age date, and the analysis of the composition has confirmed this. Gold ribbon ornaments are known from the Middle Bronze Age, and some are manufactured using soldered gold wires, but the ribbed effect is achieved here by grooving a strip of gold. The closest comparable piece on the database is the ribbon ornament with a rounded terminal from Ilam, Staffordshire (2005 T80), recorded in the Treasure Annual Report 2005/6, page 20, no.14, and dated from c.1400-1100 BC.Similar ribbon ornaments have been found in Dorset (2003 T30) and Yorkshire (2003 T40), which are compared to excavated examples from Britain, Ireland and France that date from the Early Bronze Age (TAR 2003, 16, nos.1-2). One of these references is to two 'tress-rings' that have multiple grooves like this example, and were found in a hoard from Saintjohns, County Kildare, which is dated from c.1300-1100 BC (Eogan, 1994, 63, Fig.27B, Nos.4-5).More recently found ribbon ornaments recorded on the database are: 2013 T945 (NARC-D450E6), 2014 T6 (NMS-6E2A74) and 2014 T63 (BERK-387817).",,,"Report for the Coroner by Dr Neil Wilkin, Curator, European Bronze Age collections, Dept.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 15.3 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (11.5 mm), with traces of a proto stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.It measures 79.4 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.2 mm, width at the butt is 15.3 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 11.5 mm. It weighs 88.2 grams.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.

The band was found in the top soil and reportedly at a depth of c.6 inches (15cms).Description: The plain band has a number of creases and four notable distortions positioned relatively uniformly along its length, and was originally folded or rolled, having been unrolled after discovery (reportedly not by the finder).

Composite rings have been found singly and associated with other gold personal ornaments (e.g. from Windsor, Windsor and Maidenhead, Treasure case 2009 T755). They may also be found linked together in &#39;chain&#39;s, an example from Blinkbonny, Northumberland, includes five interlinked composite rings, although the Blinkbonny rings are more substantial (British Museum Reg. No. WG.21). In Britain they may be dated by association to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), probably more specifically the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1275 - 1140 BC) (Needham et al. 1997; cf. Roberts 2007). In common with some other gold ornament types of this period, they are also found in Ireland and France though they appear to be rarer in Ireland.

A nearby grave, also containing late Beaker pottery, was carbon dated to 1520 BC (Palmer et al 1980:128-132).

BC). The unusual plate scrap it contains is suggestive of a Wilburton Phase date (c.1140-1020 cal, BC; Needham et al. 1997), and also occurs in the Isleham hoard, Cambridgeshire (O'Connor 1981, 365-9). The unusual crescent-shaped mount (No. 37) is difficult to parallel. However, given its proximity to the other objects, and the rarity of some other objects within the group (i.e. the plate scrap fragments), and the fact that new objects are (on occasion) recognised within Wilburton period hoards, it can, on the balance of probabilities, be considered part of the find.",,,"Conclusions: As a single find of more than two base metal objects of prehistoric date, the objects that comprise this find (Nos. 1-47) qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996), Designation Order (2002).Bibliography:Needham, S., Bronk Ramsay, C., Coombs, D., Cartwright, C. and Pettitt, P. 1997, 'An Independent Chronology for British Bronze Age Metalwork: The Results of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Programme', Archaeological Journal, 154, 55-107O'Connor, B. 1980.

Inside each of these folded terminals is a punched hole that was made with a rectangular punch which has left an '][' shaped aperture, which probably held a nail rather than a rivet, in order to attach it to another material, as a mount.The distinctive and large (for the size of the strip) holes have been created by a rectangular punch that was only slightly tapered, or by hammering a rectangular-headed nail through the gold strip to attach it to a solid material such as wood. This has created the flattened and rolled edge on the other side of the strip from where the nail was forced through. The punch or nail was likely made of a harder metal such as iron, which would suggest a later date for the strip than that below. There are tiny stress fractures on the surface of the strip suggesting that it has been beaten out by hand, but there are very few tool marks, and the sides appear to have been cut and are quite regular, in their thickness and edge (Martin Page pers comm).A similar gold strip from the Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-09A1A5), with perforated and folded terminals, can be seen in the Portable Antiquities and Treasure Annual Report 2008 on page 273, no.24, which is dated from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1300 BC) (ibid.p.42). See also SOMDOR-D3E8B7 for a gold strip with pierced rounded ends that was likely from an ear ornament with a hook-and-hole fastenings, that is also dated from the Middle Bronze Age, c.1500-1300 BC.But the best comparanda that the recorder can find is a gold securing strip, with perforated folded terminals, from a gold armlet or cuff found in the hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire, and illustrated in Savory (1980) on page 195, fig.47, no.1, which is now dated from the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC.Most recently another securing strip like this one has been found associated with the hoard from Llanmaes in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, recorded in NMGW-09A1A5 and illustrated in Gwilt, A., Lodwick, M., Deacon, J., Wells, N., Madgwick, R. & Young, T.

No other elements were detected. This composition is most consistent with a Bronze Age attribution, although other attributions may be possible. The strip weighs 5.36 grams.Potential Treasure items are analysed at the British Museum by non-destructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy using a Bruker Artax spectrometer fitted with a molybdenum tube. The analyses are generally carried out at 50 kV and 500 A using a collimator of 0.65 mm, and for a counting time of 200 seconds. The spectra acquired are quantified by comparison with standards of known composition. This methodology has been developed over many years by scientists at the British Museum specifically for the analysis of antiquities. Some XRF equipment and methodologies designed for use in other contexts, such as industry, mining and materials research, may produce misleading results when applied to analysis of ancient metals.19th March 2014Report for Coroner by Dr Neil Wilkin, Curator of European Bronze Age collections, Department of Britain, Europe & PrehistoryDescriptionA gold strip, with relatively equal width that tapers (c.20mm from the terminal ends) and converges in rounded terminals. The ribbon is buckled and distorted along its length and both terminals are bent back on the ornament (both in the same direction) for c.5-6mm of length. This may relate to how the ribbon was used/worn or may have taken place as an act of decommissioning prior to deposition. There are small perforations (c.2.5mm by 1.5mm) at either end of the ornament, both leaving 'x' impressions, and both punched through from the same side (the side onto which the terminal have been bent back). The perforations are located c.9mm and c.12mm from the terminal ends.DimensionsLength (in current, crumpled condition): 74mm; Length (using soft tape measure i.e. closer to original length): c.95mm; Width: 10mm (max.); Weight: 5.36gMetal compositionNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 11-13% silver and a little copper (less than 1%). No other elements were detected. This composition is most consistent with a Bronze Age attribution, although other attributions may be possible.Discussion The Roche ornament appears to be a ring, bracelet or other fitting type, secured using the two perforations at either end. The folded back terminals may also relate to how the ornament was worn / fitted, although they could be later modifications. There are a range of comparable ornaments known from the Bronze Age (especially the 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age: see Roberts 2007). The composition of the metal does not disagree with a Bronze Age date, although other dates are possible for this composition, and on the balance of probabilities it can be assigned to the Bronze Age. The terminals are similar in form to goldwork finds from Brixham Deverill, Wiltshire (Treasure case 2006 T250) and Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset (Treasure case 2013 T428).ConclusionThis fragment has a precious metal content of greater than 10% and is, on the balance of probabilities, of prehistoric date. It therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).BibliographyRoberts, B. 2007.

The composition of the gold is consistent with other known finds (including those from closed associations with contemporary objects) of this date.Gold working in Britain at this time is dominated by the casting of bars and ribbons and techniques as twisting and flange twisting comparable to this find (see Murgia et al. 2014). Similar torc fragments have been recorded as Treasure on the Isle of Wight (2011 T501) and at Langtham, Essex (2014 T698), while two complete flange-twisted torcs were found as part of the Crow Down hoard (2004 T348; see Varndell et al. 2007), and one was part of the Wrexham hoard (2004 W2). Other similar (complete) torcs are known from Hampshire: from Christchurch, Blackwater (Taylor 1980, Ha 2; Eogan 1967 n. 41) and from Ropley (Taylor 1980, Ha 6; Eogan 1967 n.43).Gold flanged twisted torc&nbsp;finds are concentrated in East Anglia, southwest and southeast England with around eight torcs having been found in each region.

(c. 1500-c. 1100 BC). Treasure case no. 2014 T15.The object is largely sub-rectangular in plan, rectangular in cross-section and has been folded widthways through c. 180. The narrow end is in the form of a hook-like terminal and is square in cross-section. The sides flare outwards from the hook to form a 'tab' with a break at the end. Part of the break is uneven and probably accidental and the other part has been deliberately chopped obliquely. Both faces are plain and have small scuffs and scratches. The bundle is formed by numerous thin and narrow ribbons which have been tightly compressed together. Following its discovery the bundle was detached by the finder in order to remove soil.The artefact is closely paralleled by two conjoined objects classified as rings (possibly ear ornaments), from Binstead, West Sussex (TAR: 1998-1999, p. 10-11, fig. 3a).A similar object, classified as a bracelet, has been recorded from Northfleet, Kent (TAR: 2004 T326; PAS: KENT-AAA333).In discussing the Kent bracelet, Stuart Needham has commented:'Its features do match those of a type of bracelet which occurs in just two Welsh hoards, from Capel Isaf, Dyfed, and Maesmelan Farm, Powys. The type, known as Capel Isaf, comprises a flat band strengthened by triangular-section beadings along either edge. At either terminal the band tapers quickly to a hooked tang, one of which is rod-like, the other a flatter strip; these two interlock to close the bracelet. The Northfleet fragment appears to have had a narrower band than the Welsh parallels, but its metal composition is similar with low copper and between about 9 and 16 % silver. Making this identification does not necessarily offer definitive dating since the type is not associated with datable objects. The Capel Isaf hoard contains, in addition to two of this type, two more broad-band bracelets which are plainer in design, and a small fragment of twisted strip which is likely to be the terminal of another ornament (Savory 1977: 37-53; Savory 1980: no 302, 195 fig. 46, pl. VIII). The Maesmelan Farm hoard has a simple rectangular section penannular bracelet in association with one of Capel Isaf type (Green et al 1983: 394-398). The prevailing opinion is that these are of Bronze Age date and, if so, they are likely to date to before the middle of the Bronze Age (circa 1500/1400 BC), after which the copper content of the gold rises significantly. A mature Early Bronze Age or earliest Middle Bronze Age date is feasible and would tie in with a similar date for the Heyope ribbon torcs with similar terminals from a hoard in Powys.'Bracelet or ring: 32.61mm (length); 65.80mm (length if straightened); 15.38mm (width); 1.29mm (thickness).

CoronerPotential Treasure of possible Bronze Age pendant from Charminster, DorsetTreasure case: 2006 T380Circumstances of discoveryFound in September 2004 while using a metal detector; it was 'a few inches deep' in a field of stubble.DescriptionA cigar-shaped strip of gold with sub-square terminals. The two long sides are asymmetric, one being more bowed than the other, but this may be due to a stronger buckle affecting the latter. The strip thins to either terminal, but the long edges have marginal lipping from edge finishing. The perforation is circular at its entrance and tapers to a less regular shape on the rear face where it pushes lips of metal through; it would appear to have been pierced with a partly rotary action.The reverse face presents a matt surface with a subtle texture probably resulting from the anvil (-stone ?) it was worked on. In contrast, the obverse is burnished and bears many longitudinal striations, some relatively coarse, probably the products of ancient finishing and use-wear.DimensionsLength: 73.7mm; maximum width: 12.1mm; maximum thickness (edges): 0.5mm; thickness ends: 0.1mm; entrance diameter of perforation: 1.9mm; weight: 4.0g.Metal compositionSee attached reportIdentificationAlthough the object is a little contorted, there is no evidence that it was once curled round into a ring. It would seem to have been a finished and, indeed, well-used object, hence the single end perforation suggests that it would have been a suspended ornament, perhaps a pendant or decorative tab dangling from an item of clothing. It does not belong to an established type of the British Bronze Age, but both form and metal composition would be in keeping with such a date.ConclusionThis simple ornament has a high precious metal content and is almost certainly ancient (greater than 300 years) and is therefore eligible as Treasure.Dr S.P.

Half of the fragment has been hammered into a bar with a relatively regular square cross-section. The end appears to have been cut. The remainder of the fragment has not been as highly worked and is a relatively irregular sub-rectangular shape that tapers away to a thinner cross-section. It is not clear whether this end has been cut or whether it has broken.The more highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a fragment with rectangular profile from Chalvington with Ripe in East Sussex (Treasure case: 2008 T425). The less highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a number of probable prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) ingot fragments, including examples from Brabourne in Kent (Treasure case: 2005 T259), Trowse with Newton, Norfolk (Treasure case: 2002 T99), and the more substantial finger-shaped ingot from East Claydon, Buckinghamshire (2013 T850) and West Knoyle in Wiltshire (Treasure case: 2014 T686). It can, therefore, on the balance of probabilities, be considered to be of prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) date.Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken on the surface of the gold by the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 91-92% gold, 6-7 % silver and approximately 2% copper.

The analysis of the ingot was undertaken on a clean and unabraded section of the break - giving analysis from the core of the ingotDiscussion:Ingots of this size, shape and composition are notoriously difficult to date / identify to specific archaeological periods. The lack of hammer marks and other decorative features also make this task additionally problematic. The gold composition (above) does not preclude a Bronze Age date but it is unlikely to be of Early Bronze Age date. The copper content suggests it was added as an alloying ingredient and the gold/silver ratio could be natural alluvial gold. A similar planeo-convex ingot was discovered within a hoard of gold bracelets from Llanarmon-yn-ial, Denbighshire. (NGMW accession number: 82.93H/1-5/ Green 1982).

The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 35 mm. The length of the flat axe is only 90 mm so it is about half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now very pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axe on page 502, Plate 69, No.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, and a short but wider example of a broad Migdale type flat axe from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall, on page 418, Plate 12, No.98c, which both are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axe with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, Fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.There are similar miniature Migdale type flat axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.89 MM (thickness: 1.49 MM). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The long edges bear slight evidence that they have been raised to form flanges. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.73 MM). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.41 MM. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. Minor traces of oblique slash marks has been noted on the flanged edges, under a microscope magnification. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.It measures 84.19 MM in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.41 MM, width at the butt is 12.89 MM and it has a maximum thickness of 9.73 MM.

Hook-shaped base metal fragment (Dimensions: maximum length 57.0mm; maximum curved width 37.5mm; surviving top width 12.8mm; surviving length at top 16.5mm; surviving width 20mm from tapering tip end 9.5mm; surviving thickness 20mm from tapering tip end 6.7mm; internal hollow mouth dimensions 11.5 by 7.6mm; depth of top hollow cavity approximately 9.0mm; surviving weight 40.3g.)This is a differentially corroded hook-shaped dense base-metal object, with a hollowed out and sub-rectangular shaped top and a tapering narrow tip end with an oval-shaped cross-section. In form and size it resembles the tusk of a pig or wild boar. Original, but now longitudinally cracking surfaces survive on the interior concave curved side however original surfaces are almost entirely missing on the exterior convex shaped side. Microscope examination of the exterior surface suggests a small area of original surface survives approximately 18-22mm from the tapering tip end, indicating that the object was probably originally tapered in shape and not broken or differentially eroded here. The original surfaces have a dark grey black patina, while the corroded surfaces are a mottled light to mid-grey colour.3. Wooden axe haft fragment (& small wood fragments) (Dimensions: maximum surviving length 51.8mm; width at top end approximately 24.0mm; base length 19.0mm; base width 3.1mm; surviving weight after drying 4.3g).A shaped wooden axe haft fragment, fitted to the contours of the axe socket interior. The haft tapers in the axis parallel to the blade edge, though remains long and narrow at the lower end. The mouth end of the wood fragment has a damaged and concave surface, compression, fragmentation and twisting contributing to the loss of original shape here. This may have occurred recently, when the finder removed and re-inserted the haft fragment soon after discovery, or it could alternatively relate to ancient impact damage to the wood in the socket by a round and blunt ended tool.",,,"Discussion (Adam Gwilt)The faceted and socketed axe may be identified as of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191-4), equating with Class 9A socketed axes in Ireland (Eogan 2000, 62-81). These may be confidently dated by secure hoard associations to the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases (late Bishopsland and Dowris phases in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age, between 1050 and 800BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 193-4; Eogan 2000, 80; Needham 1996, 134-7; Needham et al 1997; Northover unpublished 267-9). In Wales, the Llanarmon yn Il (Denbighshire), Llansantffraed Cwmdeuddwr (Powys), Llanddewi Rhydderch and Llangwm (both Monmouthshire), Old Kemeys (Newport), Fairwater (Cardiff) and Welsh St Donats (Vale of Glamorgan) hoards, all of Ewart Park and Late Bronze Age date, contain single examples of Type Gillespie faceted axes (Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 276, 278 & 282; Green 1983; Gwilt & Macdonald 2000; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Cats. 1 &7; Northover unpublished, Hoards 49,67,119 &145). The survival of wooden haft fragments inside the socket of the axe raises the possibility that the axe was deposited in the ground complete with its haft still attached, although it is equally likely that the haft was broken prior to deposition, with only the socket fragment entering the ground at the time of burial. The wooden haft may be species identified at future date and a wood sample may be taken, from which an independent radiocarbon date for the axe may be obtained.Careful examination of the hook-shaped tin object suggests it was deliberately shaped as an attachment or handle to a larger object, although the possibilities of it being an unusually shaped adornment, talisman or ingot cannot be discounted. The hollowed-out, widened and sub-rectangular shaped top would appear to have been the point of attachment to a larger composite object, the head slotting into a peg or projecting fitting. Observation of the narrowing end with a microscope gives tentative support for it having been deliberately shaped and tapered, rather than the outcome of differential corrosion and damage since burial. This suggests that it was only secured at one, rather than two ends. It is possible that the tin hook was once the hidden core of a handle or attachment with a sheet or cast bronze outer surface. This may have improved the weighting of the handle and the mode of securing it to the larger object, or it may have been added for reasons more closely linked with the wider meanings and symbolisms attached to tin as a special metal with specific properties. The discovery of the hook-shaped tin object within the same detector pit and less than 18cm from the socketed axe is consistent with a close and direct association. On a balance of probability, this favours their burial together at the same time during the Late Bronze Age, as opposed to being a fortuitous association of an ancient with a tin object of more recent manufacture in historical times.Tin was an essential metal during the Bronze Age, alloyed with copper to form bronze, with the most likely source of tin being located in Cornwall (e.g. Pearce 1983, 92-7). As such, it would have been an important and valued exchanged material, requiring long-distance transport to bronze casting centres across Britain in some quantities. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, much tin would have been carried alloyed within existing old bronze objects and scrap destined for recycling, however some was also transported as metal fragments of irregular shape and as ingots, although the latter still prove difficult to date with accuracy (Way 1859, 38-40; Smith 1872, 435-39; Evans 1881, 424-6; Pearce 1983, 384 & 407, Cat. 52) and remain remarkably rare archaeological finds.A preliminary literature search has produced two known Late Bronze Age hoards with objects or fragments of tin directly associated. The Llangwyllog (Anglesey) hoard included a fragment of tin, interpreted as possibly a damaged or miscast ornament, and dates to the contemporary Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Stanley 1865; Way 1866; Lynch 1991, 242-6 & Fig. 68; Northover 1997, 250; unpublished 274-86, Hoard 13). The Auchtertyre (Morayshire, Scotland) hoard, comprising a bronze socketed axe, two bronze spearheads and seven penannular bronze armlets, also included four fragments of tin (Smith 1872, 435-9; Evans 1881, 425; Coles 1959-60, 120-1). These were oval-sectioned and curved as if once part of a curved bar or ring, with one illustrated example suggesting it was slightly wider and thicker at one end (Smith 1872, 435). Unfortunately these no longer survive in the collections of the National Museums of Scotland (T. Cowie pers comm.), so their precise form cannot be compared with the hook-shaped tin fragment from Treuddyn. When chemically analysed soon after their discovery, the tin fragments were found to be made of a tin-lead alloy (78.66% tin, 21.34% lead). The socketed axe in the Auchtertyre hoard is of similar form of faceted axe (Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham) as the Treuddyn example and also of the same date (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 206-7, Cat. 1234). The two socketed spearheads are of Late Bronze Age form and the Covesea type bronze armlets may be equated with the Ewart Park tradition of the Late Bronze Age (Coles 1959-60, 34-5, 54-5; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 206-7 & Pl. 144C; Eogan 1994, 85).Objects of tin dating to the Late Bronze Age have been discovered in a number of watery places in Britain and Wales and probably associated with votive and religious practice. For example, sixteen tin objects were reported from a votive context near a timber causeway into a watery fen at Flag Fen in Cambridgeshire (Coombs 2001, 291). These included wheel models, purse-shaped ornaments, rings and beads, the former finding close parallel with Late Bronze Age examples in Switzerland (Northover 1997, 250). A further object of possible Late Bronze Age date from this site was a shale bracelet with inlayed insets of 'white metal' (lead or tin) in a zig-zag design (Coombs 2001, 280, Cat. 257 & Fig. 10.10). Recent analytical research of a large penannular gold ring of Late Bronze Age date, held in The British Museum collections, has shown that the gold is plated onto a core of tin, containing 6% lead Meeks et al 2008, 14-17, 23-4, Fig 1.xvii). A decorated grooved strip of tin was discovered near a timber causeway in a wet palaeochannel context, and securely dated to the Late Bronze Age, at Caldicot, Monmouthshire (Northover 1997, 250; Nayling & Caseldine 1997, 265-8). The Caergwrle bowl, in the form of a boat model is made of Kimmeridge shale and has decorative tin insets forming wave and oar motifs, and also applied to the rim as a ground metal, onto which shield motifs could be stamped (Davis pers comm.). These were covered with decorative gold foil. This unique artefact may be dated to the slightly earlier Penard phase at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). It was discovered in boggy ground next to the River Alyn near Caergwrle Castle in 1823 and was probably a carefully placed religious or votive gift (e.g. Barnwell 1875; Savory 1980, 127, Cat. 306; Davis 2011). To conclude this rapid overview of tin finds, discovered as fragments, ingots, in hoard associations and in religious watery deposits, a Late Bronze Age and contemporary association of a faceted bronze socketed axe with a hook-shaped tin object is plausible and consistent with the wider evidence.Further support for the Treuddyn find representing a genuine Late Bronze Age association can be gathered by comparison with the content of two other Ewart Park hoards known within the region. The Llanarmon-yn-Il (Denbighshire) hoard, discovered just a few kilometres to the north-west of the Treuddyn find in 1982, comprised two folded gold bracelets, a gold finger-ingot and two gold link fragments carefully placed inside the socket a large faceted bronze axe of Type Gillespie (Green 1983). Similarly, in 2002, a small hoard was found near Rossett (Wrexham) and comprised four cut fragments of Irish gold bracelets carefully placed inside a slender faceted bronze axe of Type Meldreth and associated with a fine tanged bronze knife (Gwilt et al 2005). The repeated association of gold and tin - highly valued Bronze Age metals - with specially selected faceted axes (in all three cases), appears to represent a remarkably consistent and specific regional practice. The account of the discovery of the Llanarmon-yn-Il hoard includes the tantalising observation that 'tiny fragments of lead ore (galena)' were also found inside the socket of the axe, but were discarded by the finder at the time of discovery (Green 1983, 384). In the light of the Treuddyn tin discovery, one wonders if the fragments were misidentified and were instead tin, a dense metal with a similar appearance to lead in corroded (white metal) state, although brighter and more silvery than galena or lead in fresh state. The survival of wood in the socket of the axe indicates that the tin fragment was buried next to the axe, rather than being placed within its socket and later disturbed. Whether or not this is true, the association of either lead or tin with gold, and deposited with a bronze faceted axe, suggests that mixed metals, sometimes in raw, unalloyed and unformed state, were valued and deliberately selected as appropriate for burial. Further examples of gold bracelets found carefully cut or folded and placed inside bronze socketed axes are known from Ireland, south Wales and Cornwall giving a shared western British and Irish patterning (Gwilt et al 2005, 42-3) and the north-east Wales cluster is a more specific practice and clustering within this wider pattern. A caveat to this is the observation that the Treuddyn find differs from the other two hoards and the others cited in one respect: here, the tin object was not placed inside the socket of the faceted axe, but beside it, since the survival of wood in the base of the socket occupies too much of the internal cavity to fit the hook-shaped tin object aswell.The siting of the Treuddyn find, on dry-land at high altitude (295-300m OD) and near the headwaters of the Rivers Terrig and Cegidog, is remarkably similar to the siting of the Llanarmon-yn-Il hoard in the upland land-block overlooking the headwaters of the River Terrig and the upper reaches of the River Alyn. These rivers are both tributaries of the River Alyn. The Rossett hoard was found, further east and lower down the River Alyn's course in low-lying land and less than 2km from its confluence with the River Dee (Gwilt et al 2005, 28, Fig. 1). This river associated patterning, adds further plausibility to the suggestion that the Treuddyn faceted axe and hook-shaped tin object are a probable Late Bronze Age association. It lends weight to the suggestion that deliberately selected locations (river sources and confluences), with similar social, cosmological and religious meanings and associations, were chosen for the burial of metalwork hoards in this region and at this specific time during the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC).Bibliography~~ReferencesBarnwell, E.L.

Plain socketed axe of Type Portree - near complete. Length 100.5mm; surviving blade width 58.1mm; external mouth dimensions 47.2mm by 38.2mm; weight 276.3g. Near complete bronze socketed axe with angular face edges and sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing and there is some peripheral damage to the out-turned blade edge. The axe has an onset collar below the mouth and the axe was cast with mismatching mould halves, the collar on one side being markedly deeper than on the other. The surface has a dark grey-green and black patina, with small patches of light green corrosion around the mouth and along the blade edge.2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment Surviving length 42.8mm; surviving width 23.5mm; weight 27.4g. Small mouth and partial face fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset collar. Two narrow raised ribs are visible, descending from the underside of the collar down the long axis of the surviving upper face. The fragment is markedly bent near the lower face break, suggesting deliberate force in breakage during antiquity. The surface displays a dark grey-green patina.3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment Surviving Length 60.6mm; surviving width 23.1mm; weight 55.1g. Small mouth and upper body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth moulding is out-turned but poorly defined, the mouth top uneven and imperfectly cast. Two raised narrow ribs extend down one upper face, while a single rib survives on the reverse axe face. The other rib is represented only partially by a short narrow rib on the edge of the break. This fragment has been bent in antiquity, one surviving face section being pressed together against the other, while the lower face break is also distorted inwards. The surface has a grey-green patina.4. Plain or faceted socketed axe fragment Surviving length 37.4mm; surviving width 40.4mm; weight 27.2g. Small upper face and side fragment of a plain or faceted socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset and well-defined collar. The original outer face has been deliberately bent inside out, making the original inner socket face convex and appear to be the outer surface, on first view. The surface a dark grey-green patina.5. Socketed axe fragment Surviving length 35.5mm; surviving width 22.7mm; weight 33.3g. Small middle face and side fragment of a socketed axe of bronze, with a prominent casting seam. No ribs are visible on the surviving face. The fragment has been forcibly distorted and broken in antiquity and there is twisting and inner face cracking evident. The surface has a dark grey-green patina. 6.-8. Three fragments of a single and incomplete Plain Pegged Spearhead Estimated original length of complete spearhead 270-300mm Combined surviving weight 134.7g. This was originally a large spearhead of Plain Pegged type, with a lanceolate or flame-shaped blade.6. Spearhead socket and lower blade fragment Length 96.4mm; external diameter of socket 25.8-26.1mm; maximum width 32.0mm; weight 67.3g. Socket and lower blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze. The circular socket has slightly convex sides, giving it an external barrel-shaped profile. Two circular peg holes (each 5.5-6.5mm in diameter) are located 34.5-34.7mm from the mouth end of the socket. The spear blade has a pronounced and stepped blade bevel, the blade edge merging with the socket at a shallow and even angle. The lower blade wall thickness varies markedly on each face, suggesting casting imperfections. The break is uneven and occurred in antiquity, creating a small tear on one lower blade face. Areas of bronze metal are evident, with patches of dark grey and dark green patination also present.7. Spearhead blade fragment Surviving length 65.4mm; surviving width 39.9mm; maximum thickness 12.1mm; weight 46.6g. Middle blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead tip fragment 8 (below). The spearhead has a prominent mid-ridge, which is lozenge shaped in cross-section, and a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. The fragment is bent at both ends, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. Impact scars on one lower face suggests that the spearhead was bent and broken by being struck with a blunt bladed implement. The blade edges are badly corroded and damaged with pale green corrosion surfaces. The faces have a grey-green patination, one face being well preserved with crisp definition and lustre and the other being markedly rough, with a dull corrosion surface.8. Spearhead blade tip fragment Surviving length 54.2mm; surviving width 23.5mm; maximum thickness 9.7mm; weight 20.6g. This is a tip fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead middle blade fragment 7 (above). The tip fragment has a prominent mid-ridge, tapering at the end to form a solid tip, also with a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. Bending is evident near the break, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. One blade edge and side is badly damaged and corroded with pale green and unstable corrosion surfaces, which also extends across one side of the break point. The surface has a grey-green patina.9. Penannular bracelet - fragment with terminal Surviving length 68.6mm; diameter of terminal 16.7 by 14.5mm; hoop diameter 5.4mm by 5.1mm; weight 22.9g. A fragment of a bronze penannular bracelet with an expanded oval-shaped terminal, representing between one third and one half of the original bracelet. The hoop has a near circular cross-section, though with slight flattening along the inner circumference, and was broken in antiquity. The bracelet had an internal front to back diameter of approximately 50mm and it is estimated that it once had an internal side to side diameter of 71-76mm. The bracelet surfaces have a green patina.10. Ingot or recycled bronze fragment-- near complete Maximum height 55.5mm; diameter of base 74.0mm; maximum width 77.4mm; weight 670.4g.Bronze ingot or re-smelted bronze fragment. The molten metal was cooled inside the base of a ceramic vessel, set into the ground surface at an angle, so cooling into one half of the base and up one side of the interior vessel side-surface. The vessel once had an external base diameter of 105-115mm. The upper cooling surface is rough and irregular, while the underside surfaces have surface vesicles, representing air bubbles in the molten metal as it cooled. The base surface is slightly concave, while the side diverges and become wider with a convex profile, taking the contours of the internal vessel surface. A small fragment of the whole piece was removed in antiquity near the top of the body side. The upper cooling surface has a green patina, while the underside has large areas of light green surface corrosion with small areas of dark-green patina surviving.11. Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment Surviving length 40.7mm; max. surviving width 62.7mm; max. thickness 13.3mm; weight 119.6g. Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment of bronze, representing one long-axis end of an irregular oval-shaped cake. The upper cooling surface is irregular and uneven. The lower surface is convex in shape, though uneven with slight flattening near the break, which was made in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.12. Single-runner casting-jet - complete Maximum height 29.1mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 35.2mm by 27.2mm; length of runner 13.7 mm; max. width of runner 12.5mm; weight 50.6g. A complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a near flat upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards steeply with a convex form on one side and a concave form on the other. A single, narrow and prominent runner extends from the central base of the reservoir aligned parallel with the long-axis of the reservoir. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.13. Single-runner casting-jet - complete Maximum height 31.4mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 30.2mm by 23.3mm; length of runner 6.5mm; width of runner 21.1mm; weight 50.5g. A complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough, uneven and concave upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a straight to slightly convex profile. A wide and single runner extends from under the base of the reservoir, being the same width as the base width of the reservoir. The runner has been snapped off just a short distance (6.5mm) from the reservoir base. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.14. Small single-runner casting-jet - complete Maximum height 16.0mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 23.5mm by 19.2 mm; weight 13.9g. A small single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan, with a rough, uneven upper surface, with a significant hollowing at its centre. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a slightly convex profile. Prominent but thin seams of metal have extruded between joins in the upper mould and parallel with the long axis of the jet. The reservoir has been snapped off near its base, with no clear runner stub evident. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.15. Four-runner casting-jet - half fragment Maximum height 27.1mm; top surface length 52.2mm; maximum surviving width 24.8mm; length of runners 19.1mm & 13.8mm; maximum width of runners at base 13.2 & 13.4mm; weight 47.2g. Half fragment of a large four-runner casting jet of bronze, created during the casting of a South Wales type socketed axe. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough and uneven upper surface. The reservoir tapers and is shallow with a central perforation and uneven depth, deepest in proximity to the two surviving runner stubs. The runners are wide and prominent. Both runners are broken below the base of the reservoir. The break lines have even corrosion suggesting they occurred in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.16. Dried out wood fragments (3) Surviving lengths: 56.3mm, 44.9mm & 32.7mm; maximum surviving widths 11.0mm, 11.8mm & 14.7mm; weights 1.1g, 0.6g & 0.4g (combined 2.1g). Three small and elongate wood fragments, showing severe shrinking, cracking and warping, due to the drying out process inevitably speeded up by the removal of the wood from its burial context. Careful inspection under the microscope reveals no visible evidence of working and shaping of the wood, however the drying out and shrinking process hinders the identification of possible shape, form and working evidence. The wood fragments merit retaining and safe care as material for possible future radiocarbon dating samples and the potential for independent absolute dating of the burial of the hoard.Metallurgical analysis (Mary Davis) Qualitative and non-destructive surface analysis was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken with 40 kV and 3?A for 100 live seconds. There was no surface preparation of the artefacts; the relatively high kV setting would have allowed penetration of the X-rays through corrosion layers, and resulting spectra could be compared with those from similar artefacts, but would not allow for the production of quantitative data.Results: The ingot or recycled bronze fragment (No. 10) and plano-convex ingot or cake fragment (No. 11) were both found to be of leaded bronze in composition.",,,"Discussion (Adam Gwilt & Simone L Johnson)The fifteen metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).The near complete socketed axe (No. 1) most resembles a plain form known as Type Portree, which has a flaring onset collar, with a sub-rectangular body section, with concave sides and an expanded cutting edge (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 184). Parallel examples have been found within secure Ewart Park hoards from Pendoylan, Vale of Glamorgan and Llanddewi Rhydderch, Monmouthshire (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 276 & Fig. 41; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 187; Green 1985, 276-80, Fig. 5 & Pl. 5; Northover unpublished, H.79 & H.119). Plain socketed axes of slightly different forms have also been found within a further eleven hoards from Wales with secure Ewart Park associations, including the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire, Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire hoards (Briggs & Williams 1995, 46 & Fig. 4.1; Northover unpublished H. 38, 76 & 140; Wear unpublished). It is possible that the plain or faceted socketed axe fragment (No. 4) could be another example of Type Portree, however it is not entirely diagnostic and could equally have once belonged to a faceted axe of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191).Two socketed axe fragments belonged to ribbed socketed axes (Nos. 2 & 3), however insufficient survives to identify them with certainty to type. However, the narrow but pronounced collars, without upper or lower mouldings and parallel ribs, suggest that these fragments once probably belonged to South Wales Type or South Wales Variant socketed axes (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2; Needham 1981; 1990, 38-41; Northover unpublished, 259). This probable attribution is further strengthened by the four-runner casting jet (No. 15) which was definitely created during the casting of a South Wales Type socketed axe, a four-runner casting technology being a distinctive and diagnostic technology for this particular socketed axe form (Needham 1981, 27; Northover unpublished, 259). South Wales type socketed axes are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), though they are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and southern England (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66). Six examples have been found in the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire hoard (Briggs & Williams 1995), with further single examples in the Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoards (Northover unpublished H. 76; Wear unpublished; Gwilt et al unpublished). Four-runner casting jets have been discovered within a number of secure Ewart Park hoards from south east Wales: St Mellons (Cardiff), Llangybi (Monmouthshire), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Cowbridge, St Nicholas and Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan) (e.g. Stanton 1984; Gwilt 2004; unpublished; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished).The three spearhead fragments (Nos. 6-8) were once part of a single and large Plain Pegged spearhead approximately 27-30cm long. A similar long-bladed spearhead is known in the St Fagans, Cardiff hoard (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 273 & Fig. 40). The mid-blade and tip fragments (Nos. 7 & 8) are joining fragments, though the mid to lower blade section of this spearhead is missing. Plain Pegged spearheads as an artefact class generally span in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800BC. In Wales, there are twelve other known hoards of Ewart Park date which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (both Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam (Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished a; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished). The barrel-shaped profile of the socket of the St Ishmael spearhead is a late feature, generally observed amongst spearheads in Ewart Park hoards (Richard Davis pers comm), for example in the Wick Park (Somerset), Heathery Burn Cave (Durham), St Fagans (Cardiff), St Nicholas Llantwit Major and Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan) hoards (Britton 1968; McNeil 1973, 48-9 & Figs. 6-7; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats 273 & 281, Figs 40 & 42) . The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, this spearhead is thought on stylistic grounds to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).The penannular bracelet or armlet fragment (No. 9) may be identified as of British, rather than Irish form, by comparison with other gold and bronze bracelet types (Eogan 1994, 85-88). Its precise characteristics include a near round-sectioned hoop but with a slight flattening of the inner circumference, an expanding terminal with slight inward expansion but more pronounced outward expansion and with a solid, flat ended but oval shaped terminal. This would seem to share characteristics with Covesea type / British Variety 7 and British Variety 9 bracelets (Coles 1959-60; Eogan 1994, 85). In Wales, the two closest parallels are a bronze example from The Breiddin hillfort, Powys and a bronze bracelet in the St Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Coombs 1991, 136-8, Cat. 159, Fig. 56; Gwilt et al 2005, 55, Appendix 3, 13 & 15; Gwilt unpublished). The former has a thicker hoop, but shares a slight internal expansion of the terminal but with a more pronounced external expansion, while the latter has an oval-sectioned hoop and an oval shaped terminal, but expanding equally both internally and externally. The bracelet from The Breiddin was associated with a Late Bronze Age hillfort occupation phase (Musson 1991, 177-8) and was generally associated with metalwork of Ewart Park date (Coombs 1991, 132-41), while the St Nicholas hoard also has secure Ewart Park associations.Casting jets (Nos. 12-15) only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Llantarnam (Torfaen), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; 2008; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished).Plano-convex ingots (No. 11) of copper and bronze are common components of Ewart Park hoards. Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). The Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoard contained eight copper ingot fragments as a major component of the hoard (Gwilt et al unpublished), while the Freshwater Bay, Pembrokeshire hoard included twenty three fragments of plano-convex ingot fragments of copper (Murphy unpublished; Northover unpublished). The ingot or recycled bronze fragment cooled in a ceramic vessel (No. 10) has been shown to be of leaded bronze composition, a typical Late Bronze Age signature and consistent with the other artefacts and the plano-convex ingot fragment. Inclusion of such material is consistent with the frequent inclusion of casting bi-products and ingot material in hoards of Ewart Park date (1000-800BC).The small dried out wood fragments (No. 16 above) were directly associated with the hoard, having been found next to the near complete socketed axe (No. 1). Although it now proves difficult to detect clear evidence for the deliberate working of these fragments, in part dues to the drying out process, nevertheless it may be possible to identify the species of the wood through micro-sampling and microscopy work. In addition, this organic material could provide valuable radiocarbon dating samples, in order to gain independent dating evidence for the burial of the hoard.The archaeological findspot investigation, undertaken with the assistance of the finder, enabled the details of the reported depths and an account of the relative positioning of artefacts to be clarified. Hand excavation of a test pit over the location of the rediscovered findspot indicated that the metal detector pit, created when the artefacts were retrieved from the ground, had removed all evidence of the original burial context. No further artefacts were discovered during the archaeological investigation. However, the base of a small pit feature was discovered adjacent to the location of the hoard. This contained an undisturbed fill incorporating occasional flecks of charcoal - suggesting human activity rather than being naturally derived. The evidence suggests that the hoard was originally buried as a single closed deposit of directly associated artefacts in a single small pit, one of a pair of isolated pits, seemingly located remote from any known Late Bronze Age settlements. A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality indicated the existence of possible Bronze Age standing stones a few hundred metres to the north east of the findspot, although their prehistoric date remains questionable (Marion Page pers comm). However, it seemed probable that the siting of the hoard was, in part, selected for its landscape location, with its dramatic coastal views.ReferencesBarnwell, E.L.

The remaining copper alloy objects are undiagnostic metalworking waste or associated stones. The gold bar is also undiagnostic but the gold coiled bar is paralleled in Middle Bronze Age Towednack hoard, Cornwall (Hawkes 1932) which can also be provisionally dated to the Penard metalwork phase (c. 1300-1100 BC). The presence of this gold ornamentation together with the dating from the narrow-bladed looped palstave places this hoard within the gold phase of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' (Roberts 2007). The presence of gold ornaments deposited together with copper alloy palstaves during this period has been recorded in several hoards throughout southwest England such as Winterhay Green, Somerset (Rowlands 1976, 256).ConclusionThe objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).ReferencesHawkes, C.F.C. 1932.

There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England. Other Bronze Age gold strips found singly such as at Flixton, Yorkshire (British Museum 2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16, no. 2) are broader and have more and narrower incised grooves. The annular ring from the Late Bronze Age hoard at Abia de la Obispalia, central Spain is comparable in form and dimensions but the grooves appear to have been incised rather than embossed (Almagro Gorbea 1974). Similarly, the Bronze Age annular ring from Armissan, southeast France may be comparable (Elure 1981, 48-49, fig. 55).As this fragment is older than 300 years in age, with a precious metal content of greater than 10%, it should be considered as potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) comments that it looks very much like the sheet bracelets you get in the Early - Mid BA Eogan p 50 and figures 18 (p52) Ramsgate Kent, Fig 21 (p56) Mountfield Sussex and fig 24 (p60) C) Clooneenbaun Co Roscommon F) Dysart Co West Meath - which I think are broadly equates to the Acton Park - Penard assemblages.

Within five yards (c.4.5m) of the torc fragment were also found two fragments of copper alloy ingot/metalworking waste.Description A section of a gold torc. Incomplete. The torc appears to have originally been twisted in an anti-clockwise direction but was apparently untwisted prior to deposition, with the exception of a single 'twist' approximately at the centre of the fragment. The untwisting has left a number of small cracks and bends in the gold. One end has been broken and close to the break the ribbon becomes very thin, with a circular cross section, probably the result of heat being applied in the course of the intentional destruction or the partial recycling of the object. The other end of the torc comes to an original, narrow, rounded terminal that has been straightened out from a hook. The torc probably belongs to the ribbon torc type and may have served as either a necklace or bracelet/armlet.Dimensions: Length: c.224mm; Width (broken end): 4.3mm; Width (terminal end): 1.5mm; Weight: 9.39gCopper alloy ingot or metalworking waste.Dimensions: 24mm by 16mm by 13mm; Weight: 27.3gCopper alloy ingot or metalworking waste.

The torc (No. 1) has a gold content of approximately 89%, a silver content of approximately 10% and a copper content of approximately 1%.Discussion Gold ribbon torcs, to which category the fragment (No. 1) probably belongs, are commonly found in both Ireland and Scotland and are rare in Southern England (Eogan 1983, fig. 25; 1994, 47-79), although four examples are known from Somerset (ibid.; Minnitt & Payne 2012; 2005 T523). It is most likely to be of Middle Bronze Age date (1600/1500-1150 BC), perhaps more specifically of the Taunton phase 'Ornament Horizon' (c.1400-1300 cal BC; cf. Roberts 2007), although it may be of later Bronze Age date. The damage and distortion to the torc is not unprecedented, even within Somerset: the bracelet from the Edington Burtle hoard, Somerset, has a straightened terminal and appears to have been modified from a larger piece (the relatively loose twists of the Edington piece are also similar to Durley) (cf. Smith 1959, GB44). Within the Priddy Hoard, also from Somerset, many of the gold pieces, including the ribbon torc, were distorted and/or twisted prior to deposition (Minnitt & Payne 2012; 2005 T523). Indeed, the 19 objects that made up the hoard were apparently deposited in a 'tight ball' (ibid.).The relatively simple surviving terminal of the torc (No. 1) warrants note as it is difficult to parallel among examples known by the author (Eogan 1983; 1994; The British Museum collection), however this is not believed to detract from the above assessment of dating and typology.The two pieces of copper alloy ingot/metalworking waste (Nos. 2-3) cannot be dated any more precisely within the Bronze Age but their proximity (c.5m) to the torc fragment (No. 1) suggests that, on the balance of probabilities, they were associated with it and should be treated as a single find.Conclusion The three objects detailed above qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) on account of the presence within the find of a prehistoric object with a content of greater than 10% precious metal.Bibliography Eogan, G. 1983, 'Ribbon Torcs in Britain and Ireland', In Clarke, D.V. & O'Connor, A.

Though complete, it has been crushed and significantly distorted, with one side and terminal folded over. The ring is penannular and would originally have been near circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section.The artefact is complex in construction and carefully made. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.A central circular opening to the ring - probably once approximately 15mm in diameter - is lined by a third sheet. In effect, this creates an interior but discontinuous tube, with a gap in the vertical plane for the terminal aperture. The top and bottom margins of the tube were folded over the interior rim of the two face plates, giving the ring some structural cohesion. It would appear that the triangular end faces at the terminals were once integral extensions to the interior tube.The face plates of the lock-ring are considerably creased and misshapen and at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube there is a small tear in the sheet. On one face, where the face plate has crumpled upwards, there is a localised area of damage, the concentric circle decoration being damaged through surface scarring. In places modern striations are evident. The crumpling of the artefact has meant there is little soil caught within the interior cavity. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.Dimensions: maximum length (front to back, as crushed) 38.0mm; maximum width (side to side, as crushed) 34.5mm; maximum thickness (as crushed) 12.5mm; weight 8.9g.Metallurgical analysis (MD)MethodSemi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. Several readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6 &mu;A for 100 live seconds and quantified with the use of empirical calibrations.ResultsThe average composition of the gold in three different areas on the surface of the lock-ring was:-gold 79.3%; silver 15.6%; copper 4.6%.For comparison, the first discovered lock-ring (Case 12.16) was tested in exactly the same way giving an average composition of:-gold 78.9%; silver 15.1%; copper 4.7%(see also readings of gold 80-81%; silver 14% and copper 5% presented within Treasure report 12.16 for the first discovered lock-ring).CommentThese sets of readings are all closely consistent and within an acceptable margin of error for semi-quantitative surface analysis. They suggest that both lock-rings were composed of gold with virtually the same metallic composition.The copper and silver contents match with gold compositions from other Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts in Ireland and Wales, although the copper content is towards the lower end of the expected range for Late Bronze Age gold (e.g. Hartmann 1980, 158, Figs .12 &amp; 36; Davis 2005, 36 &amp; Fig. 4).Comparison of lock-ring (13.06) with earlier reported lock-ring in immediate vicinity (Case 12.16 - Wales) (AG)Visual inspection of lock-ring 13.06 with previously reported lock-ring 12.16 confirms a high degree of similarity in size, weight, construction and decoration, consistent with them having originally been buried together as a pair. Inevitably, estimates of original dimensions can be approximate only and slight variations are to be expected. The first reported lock-ring (12.16) was estimated to have an original diameter of 34-36mm, a central opening of 10-11mm and weighed 8.4g. Recent comparison of the two lock-rings now warrants a slight revision of the approximate diameter of the central opening of this first lock-ring to approximately 15mm, while the total width of each face plate on this lock-ring, including the width of the external diameter wire binding and the width of the interior tube is approximately 12.2mm. The second lock-ring discovery, reported here (13.06), has an estimated diameter of 35-37mm, a central opening of approximately 15mm, a total width of each face plate being 12.2mm and a weight of 8.9g. Both are constructed in the same way (i.e. round-sectioned wire rim-binding, internal tube bent around face-plates, integral side plates fused to face plates, decorated faces) with extremely similar metallurgical compositions (see above). The slightly lighter weight of lock-ring 12.16, weighing 0.5g less than lock-ring 13.06, is marginal and could be accounted for through very slightly different face plate and internal tube sheet thicknesses. Visually and to all intents and purposes, the pair of lock-rings look the same and can confidently be regarded as a matching pair.Identification &amp; Discussion (AG)This can be identified as a lock-ring, a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007). The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525-9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Recently, a radiocarbon date has been obtained from a sample directly associated with a large hoard of bronze artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland. The sample of wood, surviving within the haft of a socketed axe, provided a date of 2771+-26BP, calibrating to 1000-840BC at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68-9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs (as in this particular instance) being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95-6; Lynch 1991, 239-41). What is generally agreed, is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society.This is the sixth occasion that a lock-ring has been found and reported in Wales, though they have been discovered at just four different locations. In total, around 75 examples are now known from Britain, Ireland and France (Eogan 1994, 89; Needham et al 2007). In Britain, the find-spots currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-western Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland and thirdly, East Anglia and south eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41). Their absence to date in the Midlands, mid and south Wales and south western England, with the single exception of one example from Somerset is marked and probably significant.On the basis of the available evidence, it is probable that these two lock-rings were disturbed from their original burial context during post-medieval times. Their location approximately 7-8 metres from a drain, perhaps of seventeenth to eighteenth century date, suggests the possibility of these artefacts having been disturbed at the time of the drain&#39;s construction. It is possible that it was cast up as ditch overburden and then re-deposited at some depth beside the ditch. Alternatively, the artefact pair may have been exposed and disturbed during a more recent ditch re-dredging and re-defining event, similarly cast up as ditch overburden. The consistent but short distance of the two lock-rings from the drain and in parallel with it add some strength to these possibilities.[1] Principal Curator: Prehistory, Department of History &amp; Archaeology, Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales[2] Principal Analytical Services Officer, Department of Collections Services, Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales[3] Curator of Archaeology and the Historic Environment, National Museums Liverpool",1,,"The PAS record for the second associated lock ring is LVPL-5DFE32 ReferencesArmstrong, E.C.R. 1917 The Great Clare Find of 1854, Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland 47, 21-36.Cowie, T., O&#39;Connor, B. &amp; Proudfoot, E. 1991 A Late Bronze Age Hoard from St Andrews, Fife,Scotland: a preliminary report, In C.

See appended report from Department of Conservation and Scientific Research (File No. 7513-5) for details.DiscussionThe hoard comprises of several objects that are characteristic of the Late Bronze Age. The blade tip (No. 5) appears to belong to a sword of Ewart Park or Carp's Tongue type. The bag-shaped chapes are also characteristic of the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.950-800 BC). Gerloff (2004, 146) has recently argued that the use of bag shaped chapes (Nos. 3-4) continues into Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age transition period.'Lock-rings' represented by Nos. 1-2 could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. The distribution of lock-rings shows a North British Group, a South British group, and a French group (Eogan 1969).The technology of lock-ring production is complex and the techniques used to produce these examples deserve additional research after or in the course of conservation. Similar lock-rings have been found at Harting Beacon, Sussex (Eogan 1968: 103, no. 41-42), but the precise form of the near Chichester 'rings' is relatively rare.The two bag-shaped chapes (Nos. 3-4) are of a type present in several hoards in South-east England. They are primarily distributed in South-east England and in Northern France, with a small number of outliers in Ireland (O'Connor 1980: 190; List 161; Gerloff 2004, fig. 17.9, 3). Parallels for the bag-shaped chapes can be found in the Mininis Bay hoard, Kent (Ibid., fig.59, no. 12), and a similar bag-shaped chape with two peg holes is part of the Salisbury hoard (British Museum: 1961,006.7; 1998,0901.149). Bag-shaped chapes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue (CT) complex/horizon (O'Connor 1980, 190-91), although Gerloff (2004, 146) notes that their distribution is somewhat peripheral to their principal distribution areas. It is possible that the blade tip (No. 5) belongs to either a Ewart Park or a Carp's Tongue sword, both are types that are closely associated with hoards and deposits that also include bag-shaped chapes (Ibid.).The fragments of copper alloy with fastening rivets (Nos. 8-38), apparently from a vessel, are unusual and difficult to parallel in Britain. The techniques used to rivet the strips are, however, consistent with the tradition of Late Bronze Age sheet metal container construction (i.e. the Atlantic cauldrons and buckets complex: Gerloff 2010). The rim from 'Near Chichester' vessel is smaller and more delicate than these, larger sheet metal containers (cf. Ibid., 42-3, fig. 2-3), and may have been attached to an equally fragile copper alloy body or organic material that did not survive. Gerloff lists a number of riveted sheet fragments (Ibid., 321-25: 'riveted sheet fragments'), some of which (e.g. the fragments from Mount Batten, Plymouth: Ibid., no. 140, pl. 141) bear some resemblance to the Near Chichester rim fragments, but do not have as clearly defined form/function. It would be beneficial to undertake more research on the technology and typology of these riveted sheet fragments.The 'Near Chichester' hoard therefore includes a number of objects that can be understood in the context of European and Atlantic cultural connections and can be related to both the Ewart Park and Carp's Tongue hoard traditions/complexes.ConclusionThe objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002) on account of representing a find comprising of more than two copper alloy objects and also by virtue of including two objects of gold that are more than 300 years old.ReferencesEogan, G. 1969.

The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow sub-rounded profile; the width at the butt is 16 mm. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively flat. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.1mm. A distinct blade facet is present and exhibits evidence of re-sharpening by hammering creating a distortion of the blade edges. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. It measures 70.5mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.1mm, width at the butt is 13.2mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.5mm. It weighs 56.5 grams.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge and the flaring is very pronounced on this example. It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. This example is not one of the earliest types of Migdale axes due to the flared blade and central thickening, which were improvements on the earliest types and shares similarities with later Arreton axes.The axehead is similar on the database to LVPL-DA4598 and shares similarities on the blade and profile with LVPL-CCFB76 but that one is slightly flanged on the edges. The axe also shares similarities with LEIC-2BE776Reference:Needham, S. (1996) Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age.

A single fragment of an incomplete gold band or ribbon of rectangular shape with one surface decorated with 10 finely cut and very straight grooves. The other surface is plain and relatively flat and smooth, with the grooves visible in places but not fully penetrating through from the opposite side. The surviving terminal has a centrally-placed perforation, c.1.5mm from the terminal end. This end has also been bent or folded over, with the decorated side facing uppermost. The opposite end has been broken off. The undecorated surface carries some minor cracks from the distortion of the band/ribbon. The intact terminal end appears to have been slightly 'crimped'.The perforation has been pushed through from the undecorated side. This may be a product of the perforation technique and does not necessarily mean that it was fastened in this way. A small mound of gold created around the perforation, viewed under a microscope, appears to have been slightly flattened. It is therefore possible that it was secured by a fastening pushed through in the opposite direction. It may have served as an ornament that was worn or a mount applied to another object.Dimensions: Full length if stretched out: 31mm; Length of band in present, folded condition: 23mm; Width: 7mm; Thickness: 0.3-0.35mmWeight: 1.1gMetal compositionSee attached report by Department of Conservation and Scientific Research, The British Museum (File No. 7506-5, 1 May 2013).DiscussionA number of similar bands have been discovered in England in recent years, most notably the examples from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).Grooved gold bands are also a feature of a small number of flat-riveted Early Bronze Age dagger graves from central Scotland, where they serve as pommel mounts (Henshall 1968, nos. 5-6, 8; and a recent discovery from a dagger grave at Forteviot, Perth & Kinross, G. Noble & K. Brophy pers. comm.). However, in contrast to the dagger hilt bands, the Sherborne St John ribbon/band is decorated with far finer grooves that do not penetrate through to the other side of the band to create a 'corrugated' effect (cf. Needham's 'corrugated hilt band' group: 2000, 52-4, fig. 2). Furthermore, it does not have the truncated cone form and flanges that is a feature of these dagger pommel mounts. It therefore appears to have been made using a different technique, reflecting the thickness or design of the ribbon/band. In this respect the find from The Hamel, with its 11 finely traced and very straight grooves (Case 1980, A05), and the example from Flixton, North Yorkshire, are closer parallels. The Sherborne St John find could therefore be considered in the context of Needham's (2000) incised 'Wessex Linear' group, although the form and decoration is clearly less elaborate. However, in discussing the band from Flixton, Needham has noted that the band has Late Bronze Age Irish parallels (e.g. Saintjohns, Co. Kildare; Derrinboy, Co. Offaly; Co. Tipperary: Eogan 1983, no. 11, B, 4-5; nos. 14, 3-4; no. 15, D, 1-2). The Sherborne St John band therefore belongs to a group of Bronze Age fine multi-grooved bands/ribbons that are known from Early and Late Bronze Age contexts with possible Irish parallels.ReferencesCase, H. 1980, 'Pottery, Flint and Metalwork' In Palmer, N. 1981, 'A Beaker Burial and Medieval Tenements in the Hamel, Oxford', Oxoniensia, XLV (1980), [Mircofiche], 1 A04Eogan, G. 1983, The Hoards of the Irish Later Bronze Age, Dublin: University CollegeNeedham, S.P. 2000, 'The Development of Embossed Goldwork in Bronze Age Europe', The Antiquaries Journal, 80 (2000), 27-65Needham, S.P. 2005, 'Transforming Beaker Culture in north-west Europe: processes of fusion and fission', Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 71, 171-217Palmer, N. 1981, 'A Beaker Burial and Medieval Tenements in the Hamel, Oxford', Oxoniensia, XLV (1980), 124-225AuthorNeil WilkinCurator, Bronze Age CollectionThe British Museum",,,"The object is more than 300 years old and has a precious metal content of more than 10%.

There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there may be evidence of a proto stop ridge (median bevel) as the butt does exhibit flattening of both surfaces. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (10.11 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 27.87 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.It measures 65.79 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 27.87 mm, width at the butt is 12.94 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 10.11 mm. It weighs 56.5 grams.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

The find consists of 41 copper alloy objects split across two deposits or concentrations of finds, with a small number of finds found a short distance away. All the objects are of a similar typo-chronology and are likely to represent a single hoard comprised of 31 'ornaments', 8 'tools' and 4 'other' or unidentified objects.The artefacts were recovered by the finders from two deposits in close proximity (c.2-3m apart), with two pits subsequently identified by a local amateur archaeology group (the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group) on the 10th November 2012. There was, however, no opportunity to independently date the pit cuts. The first deposit appears to have been a closed deposit, with the finders noting that the torcs were 'stacked' on top of one another within the pit (verbal communication). The second deposit is likely to have been disturbed by agricultural operations as the objects were dispersed across a small area.A miniature axe of Late Iron Age to Roman date was also discovered by the finders. It does not form part of the Treasure case although but is recorded below as a 'non-associated find'.A site visit by Richard Henry (Finds Liaison Officer, Wiltshire) and Neil Wilkin (Bronze Age curator, The British Museum) to examine the landscape setting and clarify details of discovery with the finders took place on Sunday the 13th of October 2013.The below catalogue has been constructed prior to conservation and cleaning. Several objects have considerable quantities of chalky soil still adhering to them and obscuring features that could be of significance for refining typological determinations and recognising production techniques. The weights and measurements are given only as a preliminary guide and will be subject to future change.Description Note: The numbers in parenthesis relate to originally assigned numbers on finds bags and are retained as a precautionary measure and to aid identification during the Treasure process. New numbers have been assigned at the start of each entry in the catalogue to reflect the refitting of fragments after they arrived at The British Museum. 'Deposit 1'The first deposit (objects Nos. 1-29) consists of 33 fragments from 28 objects of Middle Bronze Age date comprising of 21 ornaments, three tools and four 'other' object types. This includes 3 spiral twisted torcs, a ribbed bracelet, 3 finger rings, 1 annular arming, 1 spiral twisted bracelet, 1 spiral twisted armring, 2 awls, 1 modified tanged blade, 1 stone whetstone and several fragments of possible torcs, armrings and bracelets. The finder noted that many of the objects were found in close proximity, as if stacked on top of one another, and several were looped over one another (see details below). A second ribbed bracelet (No. 29) was apparently not part of this deposit/concentration, but was found a short distance away.Ornaments1. Spiral twisted torc (1, 12, 21)A near complete copper alloy spiral twisted torc in three separate fragments (No. 1 a-c): one single hook, a body fragment and a larger hemispherical in plan fragment which retains the second integral hook. The torc is penannular in plan and formed from a single twisted rod that is sub-circular in section. This rod has been twisted to produce fine regular ridges throughout the body of the torc. The torc is thickest in the middle (measuring 5.1mm in diameter) and narrows through the course of the penannular form to two outward facing hooks. These are sub-oval in section and appear flattened and smoothed in contrast to the body of the torc. The three fragments appear dark grey in colour and of a good condition beneath the extensive soil, with slight traces of green corrosion product visible on the largest fragment.A spiral twisted bracelet (No. 2, below) was looped around one of the fragments of this torc. The finders verbally confirmed that this is how they were found.Dimensions: The diameter of the complete torc is 188mm with the body measuring 5.1mm in thickness at the centre, tapering to a thickness of 4mm at the hook. The combined weight of these fragments is 55.41 grams.2. Spiral twisted bracelet (20)A small complete copper alloy spiral twisted wire bracelet of Rowlands type 3.B.2. The bracelet is circular in plan and sub-circular in section, with the bracelet form being completed with hooked terminals; these have been retained in their interlocked state. The metal is a dark grey colour, although currently concealed by extensive soil. The finders verbally confirmed that this bracelet was found looped over the larger fragment of the spiral twisted torc fragment (No.1, above) when found in 'Deposit 1' and was not looped after discovery.Dimensions: The bracelet is 59.6mm in diameter, with the diameter of the wire 2.4mm. It weighs 4.22 grams.3. Ribbed bracelet (29, 30)A near complete cast copper alloy ribbed bracelet of Rowlands type 3.A in two fragments. One fragment is of fair condition whilst the larger fragment exhibits additional damage in a vertical break transverse to the bracelet. The bracelet is sub-circular in plan, broad in profile and flat in section, with the prior damage to the two fragments resulting in an enhanced overlap of the body at the terminals. The interior surface of this bracelet is flattened, with a series of five evenly spaced ribs on the exterior surface. The central rib is more pronounced than the two either side of it, whilst the outer two ribs form parallel-everted sides to the bracelet. This has been partially clipped on the larger fragment. A series of incised notches are visible on the two ribs either side of the central rib, in contrast to the accompanying bracelet where detail is preserved in the spaces between the ribs. The bracelet is completed with squared off terminals formed by folding over the sheet copper alloy. This artefact is concealed by moderate soil but displays a dark grey colour overall, with the condition of the metal aside from the damage fairly good.The bracelet is the same form and has the same decoration as No. 29, found a short distance from 'Deposit 1'.Dimensions: The bracelet measures 59.1mm in diameter, with a width of 26.7mm across the band and a thickness of 4.3mm. The fragments have a combined weight of 62.21 grams.4-7. Spiral twisted torc with three finger-rings (27, 25)Two fragments of a broken copper alloy spiral twisted torc (No. 4 a & b), one fragment has three rings looped around it (Nos. 5-7); two of the rings are plain spirals in form (Rowlands type 4.1), with the third ring ribbed (Rowlands type 4.3). The first torc fragment (No. 4a) is hemispherical in plan and sub-circular in section, and is formed from a single twisted copper alloy rod. The three rings have soil retained within them suggesting a pre-depositional association. The first two rings are formed of single sub-oval in section wire which has been looped around twice to form the rings; the third is a sub-rectangular in section copper alloy band with five exterior ridges, with the central ridge pronounced and the exterior two ribs producing an everted edge. The three rings and the torc fragment are all a dark grey colour, with areas of green corrosion on the torc. Finger-rings of a similar form can be found in Rowlands (1976, 96, also plate 21), and Roberts (2007, 3, fig. 2, 12-13). The finders verbally confirmed that the items were looped when found in 'Deposit 1' and were not looped after discovery.The second copper alloy torc fragment (No. 4b), is hemispherical in plan and sub-circular in section, and retains a complete and narrowed hook for attachment to one end. Looped within this hook are the remains of the secondary hook, which has broken just at the transition of the hook to the now absent spiral body. This fragment has a dark grey colour overall with traces of green corrosion product in certain areas.Dimensions: The torc fragment (No. 4a) with three rings lopped around it is 5.2mm thick and has a diameter of 152.2mm. The first ring (No. 5) formed of the looped single wire measures 26.5mm in diameter with a width across the finger-ring of 13.6mm; the second ring (No. 6) has a diameter of 25mm, with the width across the ring 17.3mm; and the third ribbed ring (No. 7) 23.4mm in diameter with the width across the ring 19.4mm. The combined weight of the torc fragment and three rings is 94.3 grams. The second torc fragment (No. 4b) has a diameter of 137.5mm, a width of the rod 5.8mm and a thickness 5.3mm. It weighs 29.39 grams.8. Annular armring (9)A complete copper alloy annular armring of Rowlands Type 3.D.1. It is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod as a visible attachment seam is retained, which is uneven. Small linear file marks are visible on the flattened surface near to the join, with a few smaller marks on the opposing flattened side. This armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.Dimensions: This armring measures 82.3mm in diameter, with the thickness and width of the band 8.8mm. It weighs 99.15g.9. Spiral twisted armring (23)A near or possibly complete copper alloy spiral twisted armring of Rowlands Type 3.C.3. The armring is circular in plan and formed of a circular in section twisted wire which overlaps to form the terminals. The wire is moderately substantial through the body, with the thickest point in the centre, and tapers towards the overlapped terminals with one terminal appearing particularly narrowed. This armring appears a dark grey colour underneath the moderate soil, but is in good condition.Dimensions: The armring has a diameter of 91mm, with the wire measuring 6.9mm in width and 6.4mm in thickness. It weighs 61.75 grams.10. Spiral twisted torc (25, 24)Two large fragments of a broken but complete spiral twisted copper alloy torc. The first fragment (No. 10a) is sub-circular in section and hemispherical in plan, and retains a complete narrowed hook to one end. At the opposing end of this fragment the area which would have formed the central portion of the completed torc is widened and thickened with a sub-oval in plan globular form. This globular form is not twisted but appears undecorated, with a slight hollow to the interior. It is possible that this might represent a repair of the spiral-twisted torc body rather than an intended decorative element. The fragment still retains extensive soil but appears in a good condition with a dark grey colour overall. The second fragment of spiral twisted torc (No. 10b) is dark grey in colour, with moderate soil coverage.N.B. Photographs taken shortly after the excavation of the torc fragments show the spiral twisted armring (No. 9) looped around it. The objects were not looped when they arrived at the British Museum.Dimensions: The first fragment (No. 10a) has a diameter of 182mm, with the diameter of the wire 18.8mm with an increased thickness to 26mm at the globule. It weighs 119.36 grams. The second fragment (No. 10b) has a length of 175mm, with a width of 8.4mm across the wire and a thickness of 9.75mm. It weighs 66.86 grams.11. Spiral twisted torc fragment (10)A fragment of sub-circular in section spiral twisted copper alloy rod, probably from a torc or armring based upon the substantial nature of the rod. This fragment has a dark grey colour beneath moderately preserved soil.Dimensions: The fragment measures 57.4mm in length, 7.8mm in width across the band, 8.2mm thick and weighs 22.74grams.12. Spiral twisted armring fragment (11)A fragment of copper alloy spiral twisted armring of Rowlands Type 3.C.3. The armring is convex and sub-hemispherical in plan and formed of a circular in section twisted wire. The wire is moderately substantial through the body, with the thickest point in the centre, and tapers towards one end. This armring appears a dark grey colour underneath the moderate soil, but is in good condition.Dimensions: The fragment has a diameter of 79.6mm, with the diameter of the wire 8.6mm. It weighs 56.35 grams.13. Penannular armring fragment (2)A fragment of a small lozengical in section copper alloy penannular armring of Rowlands type 3.C.1 (a or b). This fragment is hemispherical in plan with the lozenge section maintaining a central ridge along both the interior and exterior surfaces. This fragment is dark green-grey in colour beneath slight corrosion and soil.Dimensions: The fragment has a diameter of 60.3mm, with the rod measuring 6mm in width and 5.7mm in thickness. It weighs 13.4 grams.14. Penannular armring fragment (3)A fragment of a small lozengical in section copper alloy penannular arming of Rowlands type 3.C.1 (a or b). This fragment is hemispherical in plan with the lozenge section maintaining a central ridge along both the interior and exterior surfaces.

Additional hammering marks are visible on both internal and external surfaces. This artefact has a dark green grey colour and is in a good condition.Dimensions: This fragment has a diameter of 61mm, with the band measuring 3.8mm in width and 3.4mm in thickness. It weighs 4.55grams.17. Penannular armring fragment (8)A fragment of a small lozengical in section copper alloy penannular arming of Rowlands Type 3.C.1 (a or b). This fragment is 'U' shaped in plan with the lozenge section maintaining a central ridge along both the interior and exterior surfaces. Additional hammering marks are visible on both internal and external surfaces. This artefact has a dark green grey colour and is in a good condition.Dimensions: This fragment has a diameter of 54.05mm, with the diameter of the rod 4.1mm; it weighs 7.82 grams.18. Bracelet fragment (6)A fragment of a small rectangular in section copper alloy bracelet or armring. The fragment is convex in plan, with the exterior surface appearing rounded and convex. The fragment is extensively covered by soil, but appears a dark grey to brown copper colour.Dimensions: The fragment measures 58.5mm in diameter in plan, with the diameter of the band measuring 6.2mm. It weighs 13.96 grams.19. Bracelet fragment (7)A fragment of a copper alloy bracelet or armring. The fragment has a sub-rectangular to 'D' shaped section, with a vertical interior and slightly convex exterior edge, and flattened upper and lower surfaces. The exterior edge of the fragment has been smoothed. This fragment is dark grey in colour beneath the soil, with traces of slight green corrosion product in the centre.Dimensions: The fragment has a diameter of 70.65mm, with the width and thickness of the band 6.1mm. It weighs 25.49 grams.20. ?Armring (?pennanular) fragment (16)A sub-lozenical in section fragment of copper alloy, possibly from a penannular armring. It is worn and covered in a soil.Dimensions: This fragment has a length of 9.3mm, with a width of 8.7mm and a thickness of 7mm. It weighs 1.95 grams.21. ?Bracelet fragment (15)A small fragment of copper alloy. It is probably circular in section, and is covered in soil with areas of green corrosion product.Dimensions: This fragment has a length of 6.7mm, width of 5.4mm with a thickness of 5.25mm. It weighs 0.1 grams.Tools22. Awl/Tracer (18)A near complete copper alloy awl or tracer. It is rectangular in plan and rectangular in section with an elliptical profile. One end of the artefact is narrowed and pointed with the other expanded in width and flattened to a sub-rectangular in plan 'chisel' form. This is slightly clipped. The awl has a dark grey colour overall beneath moderate soil.Dimensions: This awl/tracer measures 135.2mm in length, with the width of the chisel end 5.3mm and measures 4.3mm thick. It weighs 14.52 grams.23. Awl/Tracer (17)An incomplete copper alloy possible awl or tracer. It is elongate in form with a flattened section to the wider end and a circular section at the narrowed tapered end; the central portion of the object appears to have a rectangular section. This awl has an elliptical profile. The wider flattened end has an irregular break suggesting prior continuation of the object. This object has a dark green grey colour beneath extensive soil.Dimensions: This awl/tracer measures 61.2mm in length, with a width of 6.5mm at the widest point and a thickness of 3.5mm. It weighs 3.49 grams.24. Tanged blade (19)A fragment of a copper alloy single edged tanged blade with evidence of modification. The fragment is sub-oval in plan at the blade with a sub-rectangular in plan tang, with the tang rectangular in section. The blade is sub-oval in section with a flattened thicker upper edge, and a narrowed and fine cutting edge. The non-cutting edge is elliptical in profile. The blade appears to have been reworked, with the end of the blade blunted and curved in plan. Additional file marks can be seen on one side near to the edge of the blade, with traces of possible hammer marks on the surface (Andrew J. Lawson, pers. comm.). This fragment is dark grey in colour.Dimensions: The fragment measures 75.6mm in length with a width of the blade 22.4mm and the width at the tang 11.4mm. It is 3.4mm thick and weighs 25.36 grams.Other object types 25. Possible casting waste (26)An uncertain globule of copper alloy, possibly representing casting waste. The fragment is formed of two conjoined circular forms with unworked surfaces. It has a light green grey colour overall.Dimensions: This uncertain fragment measure 17.3mm in length, 13.55mm in width with a thickness of 3.4mm. It weighs 3.19 grams.26. Whetstone (31)A near complete whetstone of uncertain composition. It is rectangular in plan and rectangular in section, with an angled break to one end. At the opposing end is a circular aperture (measuring 5.6mm in diameter) which has bevelled internal edges. It has a light grey colour overall. Andrew Lawson has suggested that perforated whetstones are common within the Early Bronze Age, but less so within the Middle Bronze Age.Dimensions: The whetstone measures 109.5mm in length, with a width of 33.5mm and a thickness of 15.15. It weighs 98.58 grams.27. Wire fragment (14)A fragment of copper alloy wire. It has a narrow sub-lozengical to circular section, and is concealed by extensive soil. This fragment appears to have a dark green grey colour.Dimensions: This fragment has a length of 47.5mm, with the diameter of the wire 2.7mm. It weighs 1.88 grams.28. Wire fragment (13)A fragment of a circular in section copper alloy wire. It is sub-hemispherical in plan and tapers and narrows through the body to a slightly bent and broken terminal. It has a dark grey to copper colour overall.Dimensions: This fragment has a diameter of 52.4mm with the diameter of the wire 2.3mm. It weighs 2.41 grams.Found a short distance from 'Deposit 1'29. Ribbed Bracelet (28)A complete cast copper alloy ribbed bracelet of Rowlands type 3A. The bracelet is circular in plan, broad in profile and flat in section, with a flattened interior surface and a series of five evenly spaced ribs on the exterior surface. The central rib is more pronounced than the two either side of it, whilst the outer two ribs form parallel everted sides to the bracelet. Between the five ribs are four bands of transverse incised notches which are slightly irregular in spacing and size. The interior surface of the bracelet retains traces of the horizontal ribs. The bracelet is completed with one narrowed end passing beneath the other, with the exterior edge terminals formed from folding over the sheet copper alloy to square off the terminal. It has a dark grey colour overall and is in good condition. Similar items can be found in Rowlands (1976, 91-2) and Roberts (2007, 2, fig. 1, 9). The bracelet forms a pair with the other ribbed bracelet (No. 3). According to the finders this, more complete bracelet was found a short distance from the main concentration of 'Deposit 1'.Dimensions: The bracelet measures 74.2mm in diameter, with a width of 22.1mm across the band and a thickness of 5.2mm. It weighs 84.73 grams.'Deposit 2'The second deposit/concentration of finds contains 19 fragments of 12 objects of Middle Bronze Age date including: 1 cast torc, 1 spiral twisted torc, 1 quoit headed pin, 2 annular armrings, 3 palstaves, 1 blade, 1 unidentified object and 2 armring fragments.Ornaments30. ?Cast Torc in five fragments (32-36)Five worn fragments of a likely cast copper alloy torc with cast ridged detail. The five fragments form a sub-circular in plan torc and are sub-circular in section; three fragments are small with two larger fragments that form the central portion of the torc. The original terminals for the torc appear to be missing, as the two current end pieces both exhibit slanted, possibly modified irregular edges; it is possible that the original ends might once have been overlapped (Andrew Lawson, pers. comm.). Traces of the casting process are visible on the underside of the two larger fragments, with the casting seam appearing quite pronounced. The ridged detail is very fine and formed of narrow slightly raised ridges, with the ridging appearing finer than that of the spiral twisted torcs. These fragments have a light green to grey colour overall, with areas of slight corrosion.Dimensions: The combined torc fragments have a diameter of 244mm, with the diameter of the individual fragments measuring 20.5mm. It weighs 1119.6g.31. Spiral Twisted Torc in four fragments (37)A complete copper alloy twisted torc formed from four separate fragments; two large hemispherical in plan fragments each retaining an integral hook, with two smaller central body fragments. The torc is sub-oval in plan and formed from a single twisted rod that is sub-circular in section. This rod has been twisted to produce fine regular ridges throughout the body of the torc, with a slight tapering in width to the narrowed outward facing hooks. These are sub-oval in section and appear flattened and smoothed in contrast to the body of the torc. Looped over one of the large fragments is a single oval in section rod of copper alloy. Each of the fragments appears dark grey in colour and of a good condition.Note: According to the finders (verbal communication/site visit), some fragments of this torc were found a short distance away from deposit 2. Dimensions: The combined torc fragments have a diameter of 240mm, with a diameter of the individual rod measuring 13.7mm. It weighs 494.5g.32. Quoit headed pin (48)A complete copper alloy Quoit headed pin. The pin head is sub-circular in plan and rectangular in section, with the pin body circular in section and the transition at the neck sub-rectangular. The pin head was possibly cast on or welded to the shank. The pin body tapers and narrows to a rounded point, with the lower portion of the body bent out of shape in prior damage. The pin head has raised flanges with a series of small linear incisions or 'nicks' around the both the interior and exterior circumferences. This artefact is in good condition. The head and pin appear to be different colours: the head loop is a lighter colour than the dark grey shank. This may be due to wear/polishing or the composition of the head and shank differing, perhaps for aesthetic reasons.Dimensions: The Quoit headed pin measures 395mm in length, with a diameter across the sub-oval head of 118mm and a height of 113mm. The pin shank is 291mm long to the inside of the head and 285mm to the outside of the head loop is 6.8mm in thickness and the pin head 4.3mm in thickness. The width of the pin head is 7.5mm, the thickness is 4mm. It weighs 119.22 grams.33. Annular armring (41)A complete copper alloy annular armring of Rowlands type 3.D.1. It is sub-oval in plan and sub-'D' shaped in section with flattened interior surface. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod as a visible attachment seam is retained, which is clean and horizontal. To either side of the join are 4 small incised lines which only partially extend across the width of the armring. This armring has a dark green grey colour overall, and appears in good condition.Dimensions: This armring has a diameter of 81.2mm, with a width across the band of 8.1mm and a thickness of 7.2mm. It weighs 79.69 grams.34. Annular armring (42)A complete copper alloy annular armring of Rowlands type 3.D.1. It is sub-oval in plan and sub-'D' shaped in section with flattened interior surface. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod as a visible attachment seam is retained, which is clean and horizontal. To either side of the join are 2 small incised lines. This armring has a dark green grey colour overall, although there are moderate areas of brown copper scratches, possibly of a more recent date.Dimensions: This armring has a diameter of 79.4mm, with the width across the band 8.8mm and the thickness of the band 8mm. It weighs 98.27 grams.35. Penannular armring fragment (40)A fragment of a small lozengical in section copper alloy penannular armring of Rowlands type 3.C.1 (a or b). This fragment is hemispherical in plan with the lozenge section maintaining a central ridge along both the interior and exterior surfaces. The fragment tapers in width to one end and might retain traces of the original terminal due to the lack of break. This fragment is dark grey in colour.Dimensions: This fragment measures 42.9mm in length, with a width across the band 3.8mm and a thickness of 3.4mm. The fragment weighs 2.03 grams.36. Spiral twisted arming fragment (47)A fragment of copper alloy spiral twisted armring of Rowlands Type 3.C.3. This fragment is formed of a circular in section twisted wire, which appears a dark grey colour underneath the moderate soil, but is in good condition.Dimensions: This fragment measures 62.9mm in length, with a diameter of 4.9mm and weighs 7.1 grams.Tools37. Palstave (43)A complete cast copper alloy palstave of Rowlands' Class 1: developed shield pattern type (cf. Schmidt & Burgess's Low-Flanged Palstaves of Type Wantage, 1981, nos. 801-8). The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex cutting edge, measuring 65.8mm at the widest point. It is sub-triangular in profile, with the thickest section just below the stop ridge. The blade itself appears slightly asymmetric in profile, with one side more flattened than the other. Beneath the stop-ridge is a clear 'U' shaped depression within a slightly raised 'U' shaped ridge, which forms the 'shield' that characterises this type. At the upper point of this shield the palstave measures 23.5mm in thickness. From this shield, a single rectangular rib extends along the surface of the blade to terminate just above the blade facet. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and has an 'H' shaped section across the septum and the raised flanges. These side flanges extend to a maximum height of 30.9mm. Further detail of the stop ridge and the septum is currently obscured by extensive chalky soil. The butt of the axe appears complete and is rectangular in section, measuring 22.7mm in width by 5.25mm thick.The long edges of the axe remain unfinished, with remnants of the casting seem visible along the length of the palstave. On the long faces of the palstave, just below the stopridge and half-way down the shield detail are two distinct sub-rectangular lugs. These projections may have had a practical function in stopping movement of the haft or to further aid binding of the axe to the haft. Several linear striations are visible along the long edges of the palstave, which might indicate that filing of these edges was attempted. This artefact has a dark green-grey colour overall, with much of the surface concealed by compacted soil.Dimensions: This palstave has a total length of 165mm, with a width across the blade of 65.8mm, and a thickness through the body of 23.5mm. It weighs 538.6g.38. Palstave (44)A complete cast copper alloy palstave. Most faces are obscured and this may mask diagnostic features, but it appears to belong to Rowland's Class 3, Group 2 (1976, 326-8), probably an unlooped Norman type (B. O'Connor pers comm.). The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with a convex cutting edge, measuring 47.2mm at the widest point. It is sub-triangular in profile, with the thickest section of the blade just below the stop ridge. The stop ridge itself is curved in plan, with a concave indentation towards the rear of the axe; however, further detail of the stopridge and septum are obscured by soil. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan, and tapers and narrows in width to the butt. This part of the palstave is sub-lozengical in profile with distinctive side flanges that extend to a maximum height of 30mm. The long edges of the axe remain unfinished, with remnants of the casting seem visible along the length of the palstave. This artefact has a light grey colour overall resulting from the extensive soil, with very little of the metal surface visible.Dimensions: This palstave has a total length of 160mm, with a width across the blade of 47.2mm, a width of 27.7mm across the centre and a width of 17.7mm across the butt. It weighs 375.7g.39. Palstave (45 - in 2 fragments)A complete cast copper alloy palstave of Rowlands' Class 1: developed shield pattern type (cf. Schmidt & Burgess's Low-Flanged Palstaves of Type Wantage, 1981, nos. 801-8) in two separate fragments, with the break cutting across the shield detail on the palstave blade. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex cutting edge, measuring 64.7mm at the widest point. It is sub-triangular in profile, with the thickest section just below the stop ridge. Beneath the stop-ridge on both surfaces is a clear 'U' shaped depression within a slightly raised 'U' shaped ridge, which forms the 'shield' that characterises this type. Within this shield is a rectangular rib, which extends through the shield form and along the surface of the blade; the terminus of this rib is concealed by soil. At the central break, the palstave has a 'figure of 8' section. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and has an 'H' shaped section across the septum and the raised flanges. These side flanges extend to a maximum height of 31.6mm. Further detail of the stop ridge and the septum is currently obscured by extensive soil. The long edges of the axe remain unfinished, with remnants of the casting seem visible along the length of both palstave fragments. This artefact has a dark green-grey colour overall, with much of the surface concealed by compacted soil.Dimensions: The palstave fragments have a total length of 170mm, with a width of 22.7mm at the butt, 28.6mm across the central shield and stopridge and 64.7mm across the blade. This artefact exceeds 300 grams in weight.40. Tanged knife (39)A copper alloy tanged knife. The fragment has a rectangular section in the centre of the blade, producing a single flattened facet, with the exterior edges tapering diagonally to the cutting edge. These edges are blunted and the point of the blade is rounded, with a slight bend in the body of the blade visible in profile towards the tip. At the opposite end the blade narrows slightly to a rectangular in plan tang, which is flat in section. This artefact has a dark grey colour overall but fair condition beneath moderate soil coverage. This blade belongs to what Rowlands (1973, 47) has referred to as the 'late MBA indigenous knife type'. It is similar in form (especially the tang and tip) to a knife found within a Middle Bronze Age domestic setting at Chalton, Site 78 ('hut 1') in Hampshire, from which a palstave was also recovered (Cunliffe 1970).Dimensions: This blade measures 183mm in length, 28.6mm in width and 4.3mm in thickness. It weighs 105.42 grams.Other object types41. Copper alloy ?ingot (38)An unidentified dense copper alloy object, possibly recycled bronze waste. It is rectangular in plan and hemispherical in section with a flattened underside, and both ends have been broken and are now worn. The upper surface of this object is heavily corroded and concealed with a mid green grey colour overall. Andrew Lawson (pers. comm.) has suggested that this might represent a copper alloy ingot, unusual in this context.Dimensions: This object measures 151.5mm in length, with a width of 31.3mm and a thickness of 13.3mm. It weighs 242.7g.Non-associated finds42. Miniature AxeA complete copper alloy miniature socketed axe of probable late Iron Age to Roman date. The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-oval in section, with a sub-triangular profile as the thickness of the axe tapers from the socket to the narrowed tip. To one side, a small circular aperture pierces the body of the axe. This axe has a mid-green colour and good overall condition. Miniature axes from Wiltshire, including the Wylye area, are well represented (Robinson 1995). This particular axe bears most likeness to Robinson's type IV, no. 25, fig. 3. Miniature socketed axes were also found in the Netherhampton/Salisbury hoard (British Museum: 1998, 0901.80 & 1998, 0901.44). More recent discoveries of miniature axes from Wiltshire, recorded through the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), include examples from Alton (PAS no. WILT-9E5024) and Winterbourne Bassett (PAS no. SUR-6194D4) (see Kiernan 2009, 118-19).Dimensions: This axe measure 26mm in length, with a width of 10.5mm and weighs 7.78 grams.AddendumFurther to the initial discovery and removal of the hoard on the 4th of November 2012, excavations were undertaken the following week by the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group (Sanigar in prep). Once the findspot was located, it was noted that the hoard was found in a hilltop location, close to the River Wylye, which forms part of the River Avon catchment (Sanigar in prep). Hilltop and riverine locations are a feature of the landscape settings of other Middle Bronze Age ornament hoards (Roberts 2007, 146).The aims of the excavation were to locate additional objects, identify features associated with the deposit and determine whether there was any stratigraphic link between the two archaeological features/deposits that held the objects from the hoard. Three trenches were opened (WH12 Trenches A-C) at the findspot and two cut, sub-circular, pits were identified. From the plans provided in Sanigar (in prep) these appear to have had dimensions: 0.5m by 0.5m (pit from Trench A) and 0.25m by 0.25m (pit from Trench B). They appear (from a site visit) to have been 2-3m apart.No artefacts of any date were recovered during the excavation, nor were stratigraphic relationships identified between the two pits. The environmental analysis of material from one of the pits proved inclusive. Details of the analysis are as follows:Environmental analysis (by Robin Holley)Environmental samples (WH12, context B06) from a deposit in one of the pits were analysed by Robin Holley. The sample was taken from lower stratified horizon and scanned for the recovery and assessment of charred plant remains, charcoal, shell, small animal and fish bones.The sample was processed by standard floatation methods, the float retained on a 0.25mm (250 micron sieve) mesh. All the samples were then wet sieved to the following fractions 5mm, 2mm and 0.5mm and dried. The coarse fractions were sorted into type and bagged separately.The flots were scanned under an x10 - x40 stereo-binocular microscopes and the presence of charred remains examined. The findings were as follows:Charred Plant RemainsAssessment of the material from the floatation process showed that it contained amounts of charred plant remains. Findings consisted of a mixed deposit of charred macrofossils also present were fragments of unidentifiable charcoal, bark, and monocotyledon root material.Residue From the residue there were pieces of flint, one showing signs of flakes being struck off, four tiny fragments of Copper Alloy and a circular Copper Alloy object, which could be the remains of a Roman coin.DiscussionThe samples were of some bio-archaeological interest. The small amount of charred material recovered indicates that there is potential for the preservation of larger amounts of larger bio-archaeological remains on this site. Whether these are the remains of a woven basket or bag which the Bronze objects were carried is problematic and not proven.Discussion Most of the objects from the 'Wylye hoard' are in very good condition and represent a significant addition to the corpus of 'Ornament Horizon' hoards from Southern England (cf. Smith 1959; Roberts 2007). They can be dated typologically to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC). This date range can be further explained and refined in terms of specific artefact types (Needham 1996). The two Class 1, developed shield pattern type palstaves are relatively early types (c.1500-1300 BC). The ornaments belong to the so-called 'Ornament Horizon' of the early Taunton and later Penard metalwork phases in England and Wales (c.1400-1150 BC) (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007). It is therefore possible to argue that the hoard belongs to the earlier centuries of the Middle Bronze Age, c.1400-1250 BC. The dating of the Wylye hoard to the early/middle centuries of the Middle Bronze Age is consistent with Roberts' (2007) suggestion that 'all-bronze' hoards (i.e. consisting exclusively of copper alloy objects) are generally likely to be earlier than gold and gold/bronze 'Ornament Horizon'.The combination of ornaments, tools and other elements and metalworking waste in the Wylye hoard is comparable to other large and 'complex' ornament hoards from Southern Britain (Rowlands 1976, 99-114; cf. Roberts 2007, 147-8). The overall composition of the ornaments within the Wylye hoard is generally typical of 'Ornament Horizon' hoards: dominated by armrings and bracelets (c.58%), with a considerable proportion of torcs (29%), and rings (c.10%), and pins (3%) occurring in smaller numbers (cf. Roberts 2007, 139). However, the variety of particular ornament types contained within the Wylye hoard is notable.Although the fragmentary nature of some objects makes comparison of hoard size (and quality) difficult, the c.29 ornaments from the Wylye hoard makes it one of the largest 'complex' hoards discovered, comparable to Taunton Union Workhouse, Somerset (c.33 ornaments) and the recently discovered 'near Lewes' hoard (c.28 ornaments). The overall size of the hoard (including 'tools' and 'other/unidentified' objects) is also comparable: 43 compared to c.51 and c.53 objects respectively.In terms of composition, the closest parallels among the large, 'complex' hoards are from Somerset (the Monkswood Hoard and the Taunton Workhouse Hoard) and Norfolk (the Barton Bendish hoard). Five of the six ornament types found in the Monkswood hoard, four of the five ornament types in the Taunton hoard, and five of the five ornament types found in the Barton Bendish hoard are paralleled in the Wylye hoard. All four of these comparable 'complex' hoards combine ornaments and tools.Several ribbed bracelets are known from ornament hoards in Wiltshire (Roberts 2007, nos. 66-7), including South Lodge Camp, Wiltshire, from an assemblage that also included an awl (O'Connor 1991, 234, no. 33). A similarly shaped and decorated ribbed bracelet occurs within the Edington Burtle hoard from Wiltshire (Smith 1959, GB. 44 2, 4).The cast torc is difficult to parallel. Rowlands (1976: 90) notes the occurrence of cast torcs and suggests they are a far less common find than the spiral twisted copper alloy torc. Butler (1963, 139-40, 142) lists four examples of Middle Bronze Age cast torcs from England, three from Somerset and one from Wiltshire. The example from Ebbesbourne Wake, Elcombe Down, Wiltshire, like the Wylye torc weighs over 1kg and has a similar diameter (Moore & Rowlands 1972, 63-5, no. 75). It was also associated with annular and penannular bracelets. A further parallel may be the gold bar torc from the British Museum collection (1873, 0212.1) - details of production, which was subject to scientific examination in 2010 (CSR AR2010/61) and produced interesting results regarding how the spiral decoration was achieved.There is evidence for re-cycling, repair and intentional breakage among the objects of the Wylye hoard (cf. Roberts 2007, 148), and this is a feature it shares with other Middle Bronze Age Ornament Horizon hoards. This is demonstrated by the fragmentary condition of all the torcs in the hoard, despite the robust character of some (e.g. the cast torc, No. 30), although more work needs to be done to demonstrate the intentionality of this damage. One of the torcs appears to have been repaired (No. 10), and the repair coincides with the point of maximum stress, when torcs was being put on and taken off. Roberts (2007, 148) has noted evidence for repair in other ornament hoards and it reflects the age and 'biographies' of some objects prior to deposition (ibid.).Quoit-headed pins are a relatively rare type (Lawson 1979; Roberts 2007), and the Wylye example is one of only a small number of exceptionally large pins with flanged edges. Most of the other examples of this group are from Norfolk (Lawson 1979, 122), including an example from the 'complex' Barton Bendish hoard, which comprised of a similar range of objects to the Wylye hoard (Table 1; Smith 1959, GB 7: 2).The quoit-headed pin and two ribbed bracelets are the only decorated objects in the hoard. The similarity between the technique and positioning of the 'nicked' decoration suggests that they formed a 'set'. To the authors knowledge this represents the first instance of such a grouping of pin and ribbed bracelets. The aforementioned ribbed bracelet from the Edington hoard was also part of a 'set' of ornaments, occurring with a finger ring of a similar form (Smith1959, GB. 44 2, 4). The 'looping' of rings and armlet/bracelets around other torcs in the assemblage is also consistent with the notion of artefact/ornament 'sets' and deserves additional attention through future research. There are several examples of objects looped over one another within ornament 'horizon' hoards (cf. Smith 1959, GB 44, 2, nos. 6-8; Roberts 2007, 147-8). The most striking parallel is from the Hollingbury Hill hoard, near Brighton (Sussex), which also contained three rings looped over a spiral twisted torc fragment (Arch J 1848, 324-5, pl.).Lawson (1979, 124) has noted that flanges are a feature exclusive to the pins of Norfolk and that 'nicked' decoration (and head/loop decoration more generally) are features of Eastern English quoit-headed pins. Notable comparanda that carry both features include the pin from East Den, Sussex (British Museum: 1937, 7-16.3), Boughton Fen, Norfolk (Lawson 1979; British Museum: P1964, 12-1.26) and Hammersmith (River Thames), Greater London (Museum of London: A17960). The Wylye quoit-headed pin therefore demonstrates connections between Wiltshire and Eastern England. Indeed, 'nicked' decoration is a feature of Sussex Loops (Lawson 1979, fn 7; e.g. Blackrock: Piggott 1949), the other local/'insular' artefact type of the Ornament hoard 'horizon'. As noted above, the same decoration is also a feature of the two ribbed bracelets from the Wylye hoard. It is therefore possible that the quoit-headed pin and bracelets are imports from eastern England.The use wear and slight distortion of the quoit-headed pin is of interest: both sides of the circular head have been pushed inwards, creating a gentle 'U' shaped profile at either side. The end of the pin shaft has also been bent and has an inverted 'U' shaped profile relative to the head. Other quoit-headed pins show similar distortion, especially to the lower shank, which is probably related to the way they were worn prior to deposition (Lawson 1979, 121).Unlike the recently discovered 'Near Lewes' hoard (2011 T192), which combined 'insular' and rare Continental objects and practices, the Wylye hoard was primarily composed of finds that are local and common in southern England (e.g. the quoit headed pin and spiral twisted ornaments). The hoard does, however, reflect inter-regional connections and/or trade within Southern England.Finally, in the case of the miniature socketed axe, Robinson (1995, 60) notes that some axes of this type are apparent copies of Late Bronze Age socketed axes. However, they may also date to the Iron Age and Roman period (ibid., 60-1). While socketed axes a small number of socket axes are of Middle Bronze Age date (Rowlands 1976, 41-3), on the balance of probabilities, based on information on the position the outlying position of the miniature axe relative to the rest of the hoard (verbal communication), it does not form part of the Wylye hoard and does not qualify as Treasure.ConclusionWith the exception of the miniature copper alloy axe (No. 42), which is probably of a later date and was not closely associated with the find-spot of the other objects, the objects listed above belong to a single or possibly two very closely related deposits, dating to the Middle Bronze Age, and, on the balance of probabilities should be treated as a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric copper alloy. Consequently they qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).ReferencesButler, J.J. 1963, 'Bronze Age connections across the sea', Palaeohistoria 9, 1-286Cunliffe, B. 1970, 'A Bronze Age Settlement at Chalton Hants (Site 78)', The Antiquaries Journal, L, Part 1, 1-13Kiernan, P. 2009, Miniature votive offerings in the north-west provinces of the Roman Empire Mentor (Mhnesee, Germany)Lawson, A.J. 1979, 'Two Quoit-Headed pins in the British Museum', Antiquaries Journal, LIX (1979), 121-27Moore, C., & Rowlands, M. 1972, Bronze Age Metalwork in Salisbury Museum, Salisbury: Salisbury & South Wiltshire MuseumO'Connor, B. 1991, 'Bronze Age Metalwork from Cranborne Chase: A Catalogue', In Barrett, J., Bradley, R., & Hall, M.

Fragment from the blade of a cast, copper alloy socketed axe. Blade splays out towards a crescentic cutting edge with relatively hooked, asymmetrical blade tips. Casting seams are visible on either side and there are two seams within the socket tip. The metal is relatively well preserved, with greenish patina and possible evidence of use wear. The form of the blade is similar to a large array of socketed axe types (cf. Schmidt & Burgess 1981) and no greater typological resolution can be achieved.Dimensions: Length of blade: 47mm; Width (of surviving fragment): 27mm (max.); Weight: 38.8g2. Fragment from a cast, copper alloy sword. Fragment from the hilt: grip and terminal. There are two perforations for rivets, the break passes through the upper hole, only half of which survives. A third hole has been drilled approximately midway between the two perforations (off-centre of a line between them) but does not penetrate all the way through the hilt. The sides of the grip are concave in plan before coming in to a 'T'-shaped terminal, both of which are common features of Late Bronze Age swords (e.g. of Type Ewart Park: Colquhoun & Burgess 1988). The base of the terminal is irregular through damage or miscasting. The hilt is flat and does not show the flanged edges (associated with attachment of organic hilt material) which are a feature of some sword hilts from this period. The bend to the fragment is particularly pronounced near the break and is probably related to the break through the perforation (the weakest point).Dimensions: Length (fragment): 63mm (max); Width of grip at break: 2mm (max. grip width); Thickness of the grip: 4.5mm; Width at terminal: 33mm; Diameter of rivet holes (penetrating): 4mm; Diameter of rivet hole (non-penetrating): 2mm; Weight: 36.1g3. Fragment from a cast, copper alloy blade. Probably sword fragment with badly damaged edges and areas of patina that have peeled away. The blade has been hammered flat on both sides, creating a faceted profile.Dimensions: Length: 114mm; Width: 34.5mm (max.) - 28mm (min.); Thickness: 7mm (max.); Weight: 124.7g4. Fragment from a cast, copper alloy blade. Probably sword fragment with badly damaged edges. The brown surface patina is relatively well preserved in places, with patches of green corrosion in other areas. The blade has been hammered flat on both sides, creating a faceted profile.Dimensions: Length: 72mm (max.); Width: 27mm (max.) - 23.5mm (min.); Thickness: 8mm; Weight: 59g5. Fragment from a cast, copper alloy blade. Relatively well preserved gold/brown patina with green corrosion in places. From a sword, knife or related blade type.Dimensions: Length: 22.5mm; Width: 28mm; Thickness: 5mm; Weight: 16.4g6. Fragment from a cast, copper alloy blade. Probably sword fragment with badly damaged edges and areas of patina that have peeled away. The blade is similar to fragment No. 3 in colour and preservation and has also been hammered flat on both sides, creating a faceted profile.Dimensions: Length: 31mm; Width: 22mm; Thickness: 5mm; Weight: 15gDiscussionThis find represents an addendum to 2011 T768. The objects from both finds are consistent with the composition of Late Bronze Age hoards from Northern England, containing fragments of swords/blades and socketed axes. The present case adds little to the chronological resolution of the hoard but the Late Bronze Age socketed axe fragment (No. 1) and Late Bronze Age sword terminal fragment (No. 2) does not contradict the Ewart Park metalwork phase date (i.e. 1000-800 BC: Colquhoun & Burgess 1988) suggested for 2011 T768. No refitting fragments were identified in this case but it may be possible to identify refits with the objects that make up 2011 T768.ReferencesColquhoun, I and Burgess, C. The swords of Britain.

The bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. forthcoming) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called &#39;ornament horizon(s)&#39;, which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).The age and precious metal content of this item qualify it as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-12-12T00:00:00Z,2012-12-12T00:00:00Z,Eastern,Norfolk,"North Norfolk","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Norfolk Museum and Archaeology Service",410898,images/edarch/,44081_AEC678_BA_Bead.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMS,2013-01-07T15:40:24Z,2024-03-03T08:37:13Z

The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005). Given that it is similar to strips that usually have a greater length, it is not inconceivable that the Retford find has been cut from a longer strip.It is possible that the object was once tubular, in which case it may have formed a gold bead or similar (e.g. a fitting folded around the edges of another object). Elure provides a number of French examples of such beads ('perles tubulaires lisses': 1982, 29, figs. 24-7). An example from Bern, Switzerland is twice the length of the putative Retford bead and is decorated with grooves separated by undecorated surfaces (British Museum WG 468). Undecorated cylindrical gold beads have also recently been discovered in a Chalcolithic Beaker burial from Kingsmead Quarry in Berkshire (S.

The object is made of gold and so the precious metal content is more than 10%.The lunula is semi-circular in plan although both parts have been folded. There is one part which does not have a terminal and it is this section which is less folded making the semi-circular shape more obvious. The widest section of the lunula is where the two pieces have broken apart and then the object tapers towards the terminals. The section which still has a circular terminal is more severely folded and there is a break in the object from the inner edge. The two sides are folded underneath themselves and there is also a folding which creates an acute angle. The lunula then flattens before turning so that the back of the terminal faces forward.There is a border of five lines which run along the inner and outer edges of the object. From the inner most line there are a series of inwardly radiating lines which create small triangles on the border. As the object tapers towards the terminals there is more detailing which runs across the width of the object. The geometric design is maintained is lateral linear incisions interspersed with near perpendicular lines which create small triangles.Finds of Bronze Age lunulae are very rare from Britain although they are a slightly more common find in Ireland. Examples from Britain are known from the West of the country, there are three in the National Museum of Scotland (X.FE.1, X.FE.3 and X.FE.4) which are from Western Scotland and one (X.FE.2) which was found in Northern Scotland. These lunulae are similar to this example in their decoration although the lunula from Morayshire (X.FE.2) has more rectangular terminals. There are also several Irish examples in the British Museum such as the Blessington lunula (WG.31) which again show the rounded terminals and the geometric incised decoration.There is a lunula terminal recorded on the PAS database which is now in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle (LANCUM-449151). This example has a more rectangular terminal similar to the example in the National Museum of Scotland and again fits the more western distribution of objects of this type. The findspot of the lunula from East Yorkshire is extremely unusual.Taylor (1970) has created three classes of lunula and this example is likely to be the provincial type similar to one from Wales in the British Museum (1869,0619.1). The provincial type of lunula is made of slightly thicker foil and is narrower than the classical type of which the Blessington lunula is an example.Curatorial Report for 2012 T811 by Gillian Varndell., British MuseumDescriptionThe greater part of a lunula in two pieces. The more complete (a) has a small, oval terminal which is missing from the other piece (b). The two portions are very crumpled and folded and it is difficult to tell whether any of the central part is missing.(a): the oval terminal has a slender stem; this is the more damaged portion of the lunula being both crumpled and folded; it is also twisted at the horn tip. Weight: 40.39g.(b): is less distorted and has a maximum surviving width of c 58mm. The thickness at the edge is c 0.2mm and averages at c 0.55mm centrally. Weight: 36.29g.The total weight is 76.68g.The horns are decorated, each bearing a panel of alternate plain and decorated zones of engraved geometric motifs. The edges of the whole are each outlined by five unevenly spaced engraved lines with a row of dentate decoration forming the inmost motif. The five lines reduce to three at the horn and to one at the horn tip.The decoration of the horns is orientated across the width and comprises single rows of dentate motif (^) alternating with multiple engraved lines (-) and plain zones (P) following this regime: ^-^-^P^-^-^P^-IdentificationLunulae are flat gold crescentic ornaments with spatulate terminals. According to Needham (2000) they may largely overlap primary Bell Beaker goldwork, c 2400-2000BC.In Taylor's classification of lunulae (Classical, Unaccomplished and Provincial; Taylor 1970), the Thwing example falls within the Provincial group in terms of width, thickness and decoration. Classical lunulae are found chiefly in Ireland with three from Cornwall and two attributed to Scotland (Eogan 1994); Unaccomplished lunulae are exclusively Irish finds, while Provincial lunulae have been found in the highland zones of Britain and the western area of the European continent. An occurrence in East Yorkshire is thus outside the expected distribution.As the items are gold and datable to the Early Bronze Age they qualify as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.ReferencesEogan, G. 1994.

As a result the Milton Keynes Hoard represents the first unequivocal association between a gold hoard and pottery for the British Middle to Late Bronze Age. This is of exceptional importance for helping synchronise the chronology of gold metalwork, which normally occurs in isolation, with the broader picture of social and economic development.Excluding the fragment of bronze, which is too small and undiagnostic, all objects in the hoard cab nee identified as Late Bronze Age types. The pot form belong to the Post Deverel-Rimbury tradition, and essentially to the early to middle phases of that tradition, which span the British Late Bronze Age, about 1150-800BC. The gold types represented can be accommodated within this date span, although it is not impossible that some of them first emerged a little earlier. The neckrings belong to a family distributed widely and thinly across the Atlantic regions of Europe, from Iberia to Ireland and Britain. Precise morphology and decorative schema are varied across this geographical range.Plain, expanded-terminal bracelets with round or oval band sections are a dominat form in the British/Irish Middle to Late Bronze Age. The two examples in this hoard are unusual only in their massive proportions, hitherto rarely seen. The third, faceted bracelet is again unusual in its precise form, but is clearly affiliated to lozenge sectioned, and other faceted bracelet types.Dimensions and Metal Content:1.)

Though complete, it has been crushed, with greater distortion along the front to back axis (terminals to back axis). The ring is penannular and now has a splayed oval shape, with the two terminals now being 4.9mm apart on the inner side. Originally, it would have been near circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical form and a triangular shaped cross-section.The artefact is complex in construction and carefully made. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding to the rim. The lock-ring face plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates. A central circular opening to the ring - probably once approximately 10-11mm in diameter - was lined by a third sheet. In effect, this created an interior but discontinuous tube, with a gap in the vertical plane for the terminal slot. The top and bottom margins of the tube were folded over the interior rim of the two face plates, giving the ring some structural cohesion. It would appear that the triangular end faces at the terminals were once integral extensions to the interior tube.There are creases and undulations on the face plates of the lock-ring, while there are a few localised cracks visible on the interior tube where compression and crumpling have been more severe. There are also a few surface striations on the artefact, probably created during deposition and upon removal of the object from the ground.Metallurgical analysis (MD)MethodSemi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. Several readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6mA for 100 live seconds and quantified with the use of empirical calibrations.ResultsThe average composition of the gold in freshly exposed and damaged areas was:-Gold 80-81%; silver 14%; copper 5%.CommentThe copper and silver contents match with gold compositions from other Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts in Ireland and Wales, although the copper content is towards the lower end of the expected range for Late Bronze Age gold (e.g. Hartmann 1980, 158, Figs .12 &amp; 36; Davis 2005, 36 &amp; Fig. 4).Identification &amp; Discussion (AG)This can be identified as a lock-ring, a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007). The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525-9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Recently, a radiocarbon date has been obtained from a sample directly associated with a large hoard of bronze artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland. The sample of wood, surviving within the haft of a socketed axe, provided a date of 2771+-26BP, calibrating to 1000-840BC at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68-9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95-6; Lynch 1991, 239-41). What is generally agreed is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society.This is the fifth occasion that a lock-ring has been found in Wales. In total, around 75 examples are now known from Britain, Ireland and France (Eogan 1994, 89; Needham et al 2007). In Britain, the find-spots currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-western Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland and thirdly, East Anglia and south eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41). Their absence to date in the Midlands, mid and south Wales and south western England, with the single exception of one example from Somerset is marked and probably significant.The location of the artefact in the vicinity of a drain, perhaps of seventeenth to eighteenth century date, suggests the possibility of the artefact having been disturbed at the time of the drain&#39;s construction. It is possible that it was cast up as ditch overburden and then re-deposited at some depth beside the ditch.Recommendation (AG)It has been established that this lock-ring is Late Bronze Age in date and 2800-3000 years old, on the basis of close stylistic parallels, hoard associations and radiocarbon dating evidence. Therefore it is over 300 years old, when found. In addition, non-destructive metallurgical analysis of this artefact has indicated it is made of gold with a composition of approximately 80-81% gold, 14% silver and 5% copper. Therefore, it has been demonstrated as being made of metal with over 10% precious metal content. It is therefore recommended that this artefact can be considered treasure in relation to the Treasure Act 1996 and the Treasure (Designation) Order of 2002 (please refer to DCMS 2002, Para. C. I. Paragraph 6).Adam Gwilt[1], Mary Davis[2] &amp; Vanessa Oakden[3][1] Later Prehistorian, Department of Archaeology &amp; Numismatics, Amgueedfa Cymru - National Museum Wales[2] Analytical Researcher and Archaeological Conservator, Department of Archaeology &amp; Numismatics, Amgueeddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales[3] Finds Liaison Officer for Cheshire, Greater Manchester &amp; Merseyside, Portable Antiquities SchemeA second Late Bronze Age gold lock-ring from Rossett, WrexhamDescription (AG &amp; MD)Dimensions: maximum length (front to back, as crushed) 38.0mm; maximum width (side to side, as crushed) 34.5mm; maximum thickness (as crushed) 12.5mm; weight 8.9g.This is a gold lock-ring with an estimated original diameter of 35-37mm. Though complete, it has been crushed and significantly distorted, with one side and terminal folded over. The ring is penannular and would originally have been near circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section.The artefact is complex in construction and carefully made. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.A central circular opening to the ring - probably once approximately 15mm in diameter - is lined by a third sheet. In effect, this creates an interior but discontinuous tube, with a gap in the vertical plane for the terminal aperture. The top and bottom margins of the tube were folded over the interior rim of the two face plates, giving the ring some structural cohesion. It would appear that the triangular end faces at the terminals were once integral extensions to the interior tube.The face plates of the lock-ring are considerably creased and misshapen and at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube there is a small tear in the sheet. On one face, where the face plate has crumpled upwards, there is a localised area of damage, the concentric circle decoration being damaged through surface scarring. In places modern striations are evident. The crumpling of the artefact has meant there is little soil caught within the interior cavity. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.Metallurgical analysis (MD)MethodSemi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. Several readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6 &mu;A for 100 live seconds and quantified with the use of empirical calibrations.ResultsThe average composition of the gold in three different areas on the surface of the lock-ring was:-gold 79.3%; silver 15.6%; copper 4.6%.For comparison, the first discovered lock-ring (Case 12.16) was tested in exactly the same way giving an average composition of:-gold 78.9%; silver 15.1%; copper 4.7%(see also readings of gold 80-81%; silver 14% and copper 5% presented within Treasure report 12.16 for the first discovered lock-ring).CommentThese sets of readings are all closely consistent and within an acceptable margin of error for semi-quantitative surface analysis. They suggest that both lock-rings were composed of gold with virtually the same metallic composition.The copper and silver contents match with gold compositions from other Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts in Ireland and Wales, although the copper content is towards the lower end of the expected range for Late Bronze Age gold (e.g. Hartmann 1980, 158, Figs .12 &amp; 36; Davis 2005, 36 &amp; Fig. 4).Comparison of lock-ring (13.06) with earlier reported lock-ring in immediate vicinity (Case 12.16 - Wales) (AG)Visual inspection of lock-ring 13.06 with previously reported lock-ring 12.16 confirms a high degree of similarity in size, weight, construction and decoration, consistent with them having originally been buried together as a pair. Inevitably, estimates of original dimensions can be approximate only and slight variations are to be expected. The first reported lock-ring (12.16) was estimated to have an original diameter of 34-36mm, a central opening of 10-11mm and weighed 8.4g. Recent comparison of the two lock-rings now warrants a slight revision of the approximate diameter of the central opening of this first lock-ring to approximately 15mm, while the total width of each face plate on this lock-ring, including the width of the external diameter wire binding and the width of the interior tube is approximately 12.2mm. The second lock-ring discovery, reported here (13.06), has an estimated diameter of 35-37mm, a central opening of approximately 15mm, a total width of each face plate being 12.2mm and a weight of 8.9g. Both are constructed in the same way (i.e. round-sectioned wire rim-binding, internal tube bent around face-plates, integral side plates fused to face plates, decorated faces) with extremely similar metallurgical compositions (see above). The slightly lighter weight of lock-ring 12.16, weighing 0.5g less than lock-ring 13.06, is marginal and could be accounted for through very slightly different face plate and internal tube sheet thicknesses. Visually and to all intents and purposes, the pair of lock-rings look the same and can confidently be regarded as a matching pair.Identification &amp; Discussion (AG)This can be identified as a lock-ring, a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007). The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525-9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Recently, a radiocarbon date has been obtained from a sample directly associated with a large hoard of bronze artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland. The sample of wood, surviving within the haft of a socketed axe, provided a date of 2771+-26BP, calibrating to 1000-840BC at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68-9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs (as in this particular instance) being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95-6; Lynch 1991, 239-41). What is generally agreed, is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society.This is the sixth occasion that a lock-ring has been found and reported in Wales, though they have been discovered at just four different locations. In total, around 75 examples are now known from Britain, Ireland and France (Eogan 1994, 89; Needham et al 2007). In Britain, the find-spots currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-western Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland and thirdly, East Anglia and south eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41). Their absence to date in the Midlands, mid and south Wales and south western England, with the single exception of one example from Somerset is marked and probably significant.On the basis of the available evidence, it is probable that these two lock-rings were disturbed from their original burial context during post-medieval times. Their location approximately 7-8 metres from a drain, perhaps of seventeenth to eighteenth century date, suggests the possibility of these artefacts having been disturbed at the time of the drain&#39;s construction. It is possible that it was cast up as ditch overburden and then re-deposited at some depth beside the ditch. Alternatively, the artefact pair may have been exposed and disturbed during a more recent ditch re-dredging and re-defining event, similarly cast up as ditch overburden. The consistent but short distance of the two lock-rings from the drain and in parallel with it add some strength to these possibilities.Recommendation (AG)It has been established that lock-ring 13.06 and lock-ring 12.16 are both of Late Bronze Age date and 2800-3000 years old (i.e. over 300 years old), on the basis of close stylistic parallels, hoard associations and radiocarbon dating evidence. They have been shown to be closely similar in all attributes and probably buried together as a pair and as a small hoard association, later disturbed and slightly dispersed through probably drain digging activity. In addition, non-destructive and semi-quantitative metallurgical analysis of these artefacts has indicated they are made of gold with a closely similar composition of approximately 78.9-81% gold, 14-15.6% silver and 4.6-5% copper. Therefore, they are demonstrably made of metal with over 10% precious metal content. It is therefore recommended that this artefact can be considered treasure in relation to the Treasure Act 1996 and the Treasure (Designation) Order of 2002 (please refer to DCMS 2002, Paragraphs. C.

The decoration is well executed. Two straight edges are present and these appear to be parallel.Maximum dimensions: Length 25.5mm; Width 12.2mm; Thickness 0.1mm; Weight 1.35 grams. The width when intact would be approximately 22mm.Analysis: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a fragment of sheet gold ornament with incised geometric decoration carried out by the British Museum's Department of Conservation and Scientific Research, indicated a gold content of 86-88%, a silver content of approximately 10-11%, the remainder being copper. The sheet fragment weighs 1.35 grams..Identification: The parallel edges and orientation of the decoration indicate that this is not a lunula fragment. The restored width is more in keeping with an armlet. The best analogues are all copper alloy armlets belonging to Needham's Group 1 (Needham 2000, 29). These are penannular sheet metal bands, three of which are narrow and three broad. One of the former is plain but the other five have geometric decoration; the broader examples (27, 21 and 37mm) particularly bearing zones and panels of motifs resembling decoration on Beaker pottery; one of them, from Knipton in Leicestershire, was associated with a Beaker but not with human remains. Another from a Normanton barrow (Amesbury G41) was found on the arm of a skeleton (Waterman 1948, 180) but has no other associations. The Knipton Beaker is not amongst the earliest. The number of Group 1 armlets is small, and contextual information is scanty. Needham's assessment acknowledges the difficulties involved in establishing a chronology for his Groups 1 and 2 armlets. A date in the Early Bronze Age, not before circa 2200BC, appears likeliest at present.References: Needham, S. 2000. The gold and copper metalwork. In Hughes, G.

Truly composite rings comprise two or more elements fused or soldered together. The same effect could be achieved by using a base metal core grooved to look like separate rings and covered with gold sheet (Taylor 1980, 57). One in the Burton hoard is sheet gold grooved to look like a composite tripartite ring (Treasure Annual Report 2004, 198, no. 485).Composite rings have also been found threaded onto twisted torcs, gold penannular bracelets or a loop of gold wire, as in a find from north-east Norfolk (2004T81, BM-261FA2) where seven composite and two simple rings were so threaded (Treasure Annual Report 2004, 22, no.6).Date:Middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1150 BC.In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it would normally qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996; however this item was found before 1996 and as such may fall under the classification of Treasure Trove, and as it would in all likelihood have been judged to be a casual loss it would not constitute Treasure.Authors: Rebecca Griffiths &amp; Gillian VarndellReferences:Eogan, G. 1994.

The torc is fashioned in such a way so that one end lies inside the circle of the torc as created by the other end.The patina is smooth, shiny and a light green-blue in colour, but with some pitting and areas of brighter blue corrosion, suggesting it could be quite active.A similar torc, but smaller and with hooked terminals, can be found in the Durnford Hoard (Salisbury Museum collections).Adam Gwilt, curator, National Museum of Wales, comments: 'Looking at Ben Roberts's article (PPS 73, 2007) on Ornaments in Britain 1400-1100BC, his listing and distribution maps show that earlier bronze pre-cursors to gold torcs do tend to cluster across parts of southern and eastern England.

Although small, penannular rings are amongst the most common items of gold to survive from the British Bronze Age, they remain one of the most problematic classes of prehistoric artefacts as they generally lack good contexts or associations with other classes of metalwork, making them difficult to date accurately (Meeks, Craddock, &amp; Needham 2008: 13). Their appearance in Britain most likely coincides with the beginning of the &#39;Ornament Horizon&#39; (c. 1400-1100 BC), a new tradition of gold ornaments which coincides with the early Taunton to the later Penard metalwork phases for England and Wales (Roberts 2007: 7).

It is neatly made from five lengths of gold strip or wire laid parallel to each other and curved round to form a U shape. In the centre is a strip of gold bent in half; the two halves of the U are alongside each other with no space in between. One half of the U is flat, 1.2mm wide and 0.7mm thick; the other half is twisted. Both ends are broken and are roughly the same length. A second similar piece of twisted strip lies alongside and forms an outer U shape alongside the first; again, both ends are the same length and are both broken. Two further parallel lengths of strip-twisted wire are then added, but on one half of the U shape the ends are broken off short, and here the wire is squashed and rather flattened. A small rivet hole, c. 0.8-0.9mm in diameter, has been cut through these two shorter pieces. A flat, untwisted strip forms the outer border, again broken off even shorter on one half of the U, only just past the bend.The lengths of wire have been soldered together using a gold solder and the quality of the workmanship is good. The breaks look fresh. The entire object has been bent across its short axis and some of the wires have sprung apart. There is no noticeable difference between both faces of the object.Dimensions: Surviving maximum width 8.7mm. Unbent surviving length c. 26mm. Thickness c. 0.9-1.0mm. Weight 1.5g.Discussion: Barbara Armbruster has drawn attention to two parallels, both Bronze Age bracelets, one from the Salcombe shipwreck find off Devon, and one from in the Middle Bronze Age Burton hoard found near Wrexham (PAS-5B1745, no. 2). The gauges of the wire on all three objects are similar, but both of the bracelets have all strands of wire twisted, and have straight rather than curved ends. The Burton bracelet has no perforation, whereas the Salcombe object has a perforation close to the end similar to that on the Anstley fragment.The Burton hoard has been acquired by the National Museum of Wales. The Salcombe shipwreck find has been acquired by the British Museum and a SEM photograph of the bracelet has been published in B. Roberts and C.

One is made from twisted gold, one is a round, smooth rod with a pitted surface, the last is also round but the feint hint of of a twisted surface survives on one side. The hoard was found in the parish of Ancaster, Lincolnshire.Description 1. Three gold rods fused together. All three rods may once have been part of the same long tapering twisted wire rod golden in colour with slightly pitted surfaces which have a mid reddish brown patina. Total Weight: 13.5g, Max. Length: 41.24mm, Max. Width: 8.65mm,a) Rod of twisted gold. This solid rod is formed from three wires twisted and fused together. It is tapered towards one end where the deep groove of the twists has worn down to an almost flat surface. Max. Length: 41.24mm, Max. Width of rod: 4.84mmb) Curved gold rod with faint evidence of twisting. This narrower roughly circular sectioned rod is bent into a shallow curve and fused along one side to the larger twisted rod. One end curves over rod c) to which this is also fused. The opposite end, closet to rod a) bears faint evidence on the surface of the ridges of twisted wire. It is proposed this item originally had a similar twisted wire structure to rod a) prior to being subjected to the heat process that fused the three rods. Max. Length: 28.33mm, Max. Width of rod: 2.88mmc) Smooth round gold rod. Almost circular in section this rod tapes towards the same end as the tapered end of rod a). It has a slight kink midway along its length and is fused along one side to both rod a) and rod b). At the tapered end is a possible hint of a once ribbed surface like the twisted effect of a) and b) but this is not clear. Max. Length: 29.29mm, Max. Width of rod: 3.28mmDiscussion The dimensions of this gold fragments would be compatible with sections from a bracelet or perhaps a torc. Bracelets and torcs made from twisted gold have been found in Britain for example, the twisted gold wire bracelet and a flange-twisted gold wire torc were found in a hoard of gold ornaments and copper alloy tools from Burton, Wrexham, Wales (PAS-5B1745) and a flange-twisted gold torc from Shorewell on the Isle of Wight (IOW-C0C054). The bracelet from Burton is formed from 6 strands of twisted gold wires each only 0.8mm in diameter and joined together at either end of the bracelet by a flat rectangular terminal. The torc from Burton, on the other hand is 4.1mm in diameter. The diameter of each of the fused wires therefore corresponds better with the torc dimensions than the bracelet. Unfortunately the melted condition of the fused gold rods gives the impression of a flatter twisted wire than the flange types noted above. It is possible before heating the twisted wires were originally flatter and less rounded. The analysis of the flange-twisted torc of Shorewell torc suggested the style corresponds to the Penard phase (c. 1300-1150BC) (Roberts 2007, Murgia et al 2011). These fused rods may therefore be evidence for recycling of gold torcs in the Middle Bronze Age. In addition, the diameter and appearance is comparable to the gold large flange-twisted torc found at the Isle of Axholme, North Lincolnshire (BM 1880, 0820.36, Murgia et al 2011, 2.3.5).Conclusion The objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).ReferencesMurgia, A., Melkonian, M. & Roberts, B.W. forthcoming b.

The rod then extends down below either sphere perpendicular to the joining rod. The entire object has squared U-shaped profile with the spheres at the two corners. The object appears to be broken in antiquity on both sides of the open end of the U so its original complete form is unknown. The bulbous sphere shapes are found on Iron Age items of personal ornament and dress such a pins and brooches but in such instances they tend to be found in a group of four spheres arranged in a cruciform shape such as the plate brooch from the Batheaston hoard BM.1989,0601.200.

Width: 23.44Discussion The Sompting type socketed axe fragment dates the hoard to the Llyn Fawr metal working phase of the Earliest Iron Age (800-600 BC). Comparable axes and sickle blades were recovered in the Earliest Iron Age hoard from Wardour, Wiltshire (2011 T684) which was found nearby. It is of interest that the latter hoard contained items of personal dress including toggles. Although none are comparable in form to the undiagnostic object recovered here, the combination of object types represented at Hindon and Wardour may be indicative of the possibility that this was a dress related item. In contrast to the Wardour hoard is the number of casting waste fragments including spues and the copper alloy ingot found in this hoard. However in southern England hoards containing socketed axes and ingot fragments are common from the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park phase (1000-800BC). The gold sheet fragment is an unusual find for the Earliest Iron Age (O'Connor 2007) but gold is frequently recovered from the preceding two centuries (see past Treasure Annual Reports). It is proposed that the combination of fragmentary objects, casting waste and incomplete gold sheet are a collection of material pertaining to Earliest Iron Age metalsmithing. This may, therefore, be a metalworker's hoard rather than the more elaborate ritually deposited large collections of complete artefacts such as the Wardour hoard or Netherhampton.ReferencesO'Connor, B. 2007.Llyn Fawr metalwork in Britain: a review.

Gold flanged twisted torcs finds are concentrated in East Anglia, southwest and southeast England with around 8 torcs having been found in each region. They are present in smaller numbers in Wales and into northern and central Britain (Roberts 2007).

It is to be known as the ""Near North Cove"" hoard. Description 1. Copper alloy socketed axe, Class B- Southern English ribbed type. The socket mouth is rounded and the axe has a double mouth moulding, the higher of which is more prominent. The axe has 5 longitudinal ribs on each face, starting from the second mouth moulding and extending approximately a third of the way down the axe finishing just below the side loop. The body runs slightly flared but parallel until the cutting tip where it then expands out. Patina is green, porous and corroded especially at the cutting edge. On one face there is a small area which is less corroded, darker green and smooth although scratched. The axe also has an internal haft rib. Found inside the axe were two gold lock-rings one of which is lodged in the axe, and further inside, are more unidentifiable lodged gold object(s?).

Weight: 0.9 g (including internal soil), Length: 25.2mm, Thickness 8.0 mmDiscussion The Southern English ribbed socketed axe type dates to the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC) and are distributed throughout southern, eastern and central Britain (Needham 1990, 32-38). They are contemporary with lock-rings whose distribution in Britain is fairly widespread falling geographically into either the North British Group (of which there are 20 examples) and South British group (8 examples). The presence of the side-plate and an undecorated face-plate are typically features of lock-rings from the North British Group, however geographically the 'Near North Cove' gold lock-rings fall into the South British Group (Eogan 1969). The lock-ring from this hoard can be paralleled to the 'Feltwell Fen' hoard, where gold foil from a lock ring was found together with a socketed axe head in Norfolk (Eogan 1969). Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in other hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard is comparable to the to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).Conclusion The objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).ReferencesEogan, G. 1969.Lock-Rings' of the Late Bronze Age.Royal Irish Academy Proceedings Volume 67 Gwilt, A, et al 2005.A Late Bronze Age Hoard from Trevalyn Farm, Rossett, Wrexham.Studia Celtica, XXXIX (2005), 27-61 Needham, S. 1990.The Petters Late of Bronze Age Metalwork: An Analytical Study of Thames Valley Metalworking in Its Settlement Context.

In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat.

The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 30.54mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Diagonal file marks are present on the flat surface, and minor horizontal 'cracks' or casting flaws are present on the curved side.The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina.It measures 72.21mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 30.53mm, width at the butt is 14.51mm and it has a maximum thickness of 5.05mm. It weighs 39.2 grams.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped.These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Reference:Needham, S.

The main surviving length retains its spiral twist, but the form has been misshapen and partly straightened. The second part consists of a plain hooked terminal which retains its curved shape. Comparison of the narrow broken ends, which both show clean metal, and red discoloration of corrosion on both pieces suggests the terminal and the larger section were once joined and may have been broken recently. The patina is pale yellow with extensive but quite thin green and white corrosion with a small patch of red corrosion near the break.Total Weight 56.7g, Total length: 212.68a) Weight: 53.9g, Length: 193.39 mm, Max Thickness: 6.85mmb) Weight 2.8g, Length: 31.21 mm, Max Thickness: 3.34mm59 Copper alloy spiral twisted torc in 4 pieces.

As the conditions for excavation were ideal (i.e. 'dry and bright'), a small team was able to thoroughly excavate a 3 x 3 meter trench within one day, including extensive sieving and metal detecting of the spoil heap. The concern was that due to its highly visible location and accessibility, a more extensive archaeological project would put the site at risk for illegal activity.The County Archaeologists, HER Officer, and Finds Liaison Officer hope to return to the site as soon as possible to conduct geophysical survey, due to the discovery of a deep cut in the chalk, potentially indicating the end of a ditch or enclosure at one corner of the trench (Feature 4, Contexts 5 & 7 listed below). This type of feature seems to be consistent with other Middle Bronze Age hoards and vessels which have been discovered within the direct vicinity of enclosures from the period.Items suggested for inclusion into the Treasure assemblage originate generally from Contexts 2 and 3: Context 2 being the backfill of the metal detected hole where the vessel and majority of the assemblage was found; Context 3, which consisted of subsoil throughout the trench, could be included if found to be appropriate.Context 2 yielded a few additional objects, mostly fragments of amber beads, presumably from the coiled necklaces, two fragments of which had been found with beads still attached during the initial recovery by the finder. In addition to amber beads, a small amount of further coiled fragments were found within the context as well. Most of these objects were located during the intensive sieving process directly after removal and were probably missed due to their mainly non-metallic composition during the finder's initial search. No large objects or complex fragments were discovered during the excavation which would necessitate extensive reassessment of the entire assemblage.Context 3 yielded a mixture of objects that seemed to be relatively mixed in dating; however, a few pieces of possible Bronze Age vessel were discovered that would be appropriate for inclusion in the treasure case, as it is likely they were part of the vessel. I would suggest that most items from this context should not be included, so it is the prerogative of the specialist if this context should be included in part.A full list of contexts and features is listed here:Context 1: TopsoilContext 2: Backfill of Metal Detected hole [8]Context 3: SubsoilFeature 4: ?cut featureContext 5: Fill of [4]Context 6: Chalk bedrockContext 7: Fill of [4] below Context 5Context 8: Cut created by Metal DetectoristAll in all, the results of the excavations were useful in that they allowed us to assess more carefully the context of the cut within the chalk which facilitated the preservation of the bottom portion of the vessel and indeed the remaining assemblage interred with the vessel. A full post-excavation report will be forthcoming, but will not necessarily be appropriate to the valuation of the treasure assemblage which has been fully represented within this report.No photographs have been taken of these objects before transport to the British Museum.The following list is a catalogue of the objects found during the excavations which should be included in the Treasure report and evaluation:TN11 Context 261.

Their dating can be broken down according to type and metalwork phase (see Needham 1996, Needham et. al. 1997). The two Class 2 Group 2 side flanged palstaves, can be placed in the Taunton metalwork phase (c. 1400-1250 BC) (cf. Rowlands 1976, 31-32) or on the basis of finds in other regions possibly even in the Acton Park metalwork phase (c. 1500-1400 BC) (cf. Burgess 1964, 120; O'Connor 1980, 53). However, the Class 2, Group 3 side flanged palstaves occur only in Taunton metalwork phase (c. 1400-1250 BC) hoards (O'Connor 1980, 53). The 5 'Sussex Loop' bracelets, 8 finger-rings; 4 twisted torcs, 4 identifiable tutuli (or Monkswood ornaments) and Quoit-headed pin fragments are traditionally grouped in a Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' which is now placed in the Taunton and Penard metalwork phases (c. 1400-1150 BC) (Smith 1959a; Roberts 2007). The coiled spiral ring fragments date typically to the central European late Middle Bronze Age Tumulus culture (1600-1300 BC). The other objects are less well dated with the sheet gold discs placed in the Middle Bronze Age in France (c. 1600-1300 BC) (Elure 1981, 39-41). Only one of the lozenge-headed pins has been found before and the excavation context has not allowed especially precise dating (Curwen 1954, 202, Fig 62). The amber beads are not typologically diagnostic and are relatively rare in Britain during the Middle Bronze Age (Beck and Shennan 1991, 99-101). The vast majority of the objects were found together inside part of a plain large urn or bucket urn which are not a closely dated types beyond mid-late 2nd millennium BC (Ellison 1980, 32-34), it is possible to argue for a relatively narrow date of c. 1400-1250 BC for the deposition.The distribution of the object types in the 'Near Lewes' hoard varies from the common and the local to the rare and the exotic. There are not only typical local and regional forms but also forms which are either rare or currently unknown in Britain and instead have continental origins. The Group 2 Class 2 side flanged palstaves have a relatively wide distribution across England south of a line between the Humber and the Mersey but are concentrated especially in the upper Thames area (O'Connor 1980, 52-3). Local parallels are known from Barnham, Sussex (Rowlands 1976, 231-2; plate 3, 127) and Nr Bognor, Sussex (O'Connor 1980, Fig 13C). However, Group 2 Class 3 palstaves have a more restricted range and, largely cluster, with a few outliers, south of the line of the Thames and tend to be a south coast type as at St. Leonards Marina, Sussex (Rowlands 1976, 269, Plate 3, no. 2). The two are often found together in hoards (Rowlands 1976, Map 4; O'Connor 1980, 53). The deposition of Class 2 Groups 2-3 palstaves is a feature typical of finds from the Brighton region and extends eastward to Kent (Rowlands 1976, 129). The presence of palstaves, but lack of other larger weapons such as rapiers, is consistent with the limited evidence for weapon deposition in the Sussex region (Rowlands, 1976, 129, 131). This pattern is apparently confirmed in the Nr. Lewes hoard with the lack of any rapier, dagger or spear fragments.The 'Sussex loop' bracelets and Quoit-headed pins are insular varieties of Middle Bronze Age ornaments that are found only in southern England (Roberts 2007, 143; Pendleton in prep). 'Sussex loop' bracelets in particular are only found within the vicinity of Brighton. They are often found in pairs which may include a mixture of round and lozenge section as at Hollingbury Castle, Sussex (Rowlands 1976, 267) but the presence of an odd number is not particularly unusual but the 'Nr. Lewes' hoard does have the largest number of 'Sussex loop' bracelets so far discovered. Quoit headed pins are found south of a line between the Severn and the Wash (Rowlands, 1976, map 21; Pendleton in prep) and have been found with 'Sussex loop' bracelets in hoards such as East Dean, Sussex (Rowlands 1976, 266). The bronze spiral-twisted bar torcs are found mainly throughout southern England as at Hollingbury, Sussex where one was found accompanying four 'Sussex Loop' bracelets and three coiled finger rings (Rowlands 1976, 267) but with a concentration towards the southwest (Rowlands 1976, map 22; Roberts 2007, Fig 4. and Appendix). This is in contrast to the broader distribution of gold spiral-twisted bar torcs which are concentrated throughout western Britain but have also been found in eastern Britain (Roberts 2007, Fig 4. and Appendix). Bronze coiled finger rings are relatively numerous throughout southern England with a significant concentration in hoards in Sussex (Roberts 2007, Fig 4 and Appendix) as well as at the settlement site of Black Patch where they were apparently found placed on the settlement floor (Drewett 1982).The pin with a Lozenge-shaped plate is a decidedly unusual find. The only previously published example of this pin was an apparently complete example found in a barrow or hoard 'between Brighton and Lewes' known as the Hanley Cross: this nearby hoard also contained a pair of Sussex Loop bracelets and a quoit headed pin and so again suggests a local tradition (Curwen 1954, 201-2; Rowlands 1976, 267). The tutuli or 'Monkswood ornament' is partially paralleled in the Monkswood hoard, Somerset where a 'small sheet bronze cone' was found but, unlike the 'Near Lewes' example, has no flange (Smith 1959b, Fig 16. Rowlands 1976, 257). It is more precisely paralleled in the 'disc-shaped fitting' - or small sheet bronze cone surrounded by a flange comprising two concentric corrugations found in the filling or a posthole in hut (roundhouse) 1 at the settlement site of Chalton, Hampshire (Cunliffe 1970, 11, Fig 5). Additionally, a Class 2 Group 2 palstave, identical to the 'Near Lewes' hoard was also found on the floor of hut (roundhouse) 1 (ibid.).There have been no previous finds of the gold appliqu discs in Britain and the known finds have been confined to northern and central France. There are parallel finds from Magny-Lambert although the decoration is simpler (Elure 1982, 39-41). The diameters, which range from c. 34-39 mm, are closer to that of an example from Barbuise-Courtavant (35mm, as compared to Magny Lambert 22mm, Elure 1982, 40). The coiled spiral rolls on necklaces with amber beads are thought to be north German in origin (Sprockhoff 1956, 161-162) but coiled spiral rolls are relatively widespread and are evidenced in hoards such as Wolfersheim, Germany (Kubach 1977, Fig. 118) and Kolkhagen, Germany (Laux 1976, Fig 57). They have been found once before in Britain complete with rod fragments in an unpublished and little known West Ashling hoard, Chichester, West Sussex and now in Chichester Museum (Needham unpublished). It also contained quoit-headed pin fragments, an amber bead and tutuli. The few amber beads which have been found in Middle Bronze Age in Britain have are found near the coastal and major riverine areas of southern England (Beck and Shennan 1991, 99-101). The ceramic vessel appears to be typical for Sussex during the Later Bronze Age (Ellison 1980, 32-34).There has never been a closely comparable hoard found in Britain beyond the little known from West Ashling hoard, West Sussex (Needham unpublished) which is of a similar size but still lacks the gold discs, 'Sussex Loop' bracelets and palstaves but contains spearhead fragments, saws and awls. The closest parallel might be the poorly documented Hanley Cross barrow or hoard (Curwen 1954, 202) although this lacks several object types and was apparently placed with a skeleton rather than in a ceramic vessel. The complete length of around 19 inches (48cm), with the lozenge-shaped plate around 4 inches (10cm) below the pin head suggests the potential dimensions of the 'Near Lewes' pin. The head of barrow find was flat with a central boss and the pierced eye behind the lozenge plate was suggested to have potential for the attachment of a cord or chain (Curwen 1954) but is not obviously a variant of the swollen neck pins as classically argued (Hawkes 1942, 41). The placing of hoards in pots is relatively rare in Britain during the Middle Bronze Age though is evidenced with Picardy pins at Ramsgate, Kent (Hawkes 1942) and 14 palstaves at Birchington, Kent (Coombs 1971, 403).The continental connections evidenced in the 'Near Lewes' hoard can be clearly seen in the gold appliqu discs, the amber beads, tutuli or Monkswood ornament and the coiled spiral rolls which, with the rare exceptions of the amber beads and tutuli, have never before been found in Britain. The placing of the objects in a ceramic vessel is also very rare in Britain during the Middle Bronze Age and is far more common in northern France (e.g. Briard 1966, 288-91). These 'foreign' objects were placed with distinctive local forms such as the 'Sussex loop' bracelets and the pin with a Lozenge-shaped plate as well as with more typically widely distributed southern English objects such as Quoit-headed pins, Group 2 Class 2 and 3 palstaves and coiled finger rings. In this sense, the 'Near Lewes' hoard can be regarded as the most spectacular and overtly continental manifestation of a distinct region of Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' hoards (Roberts 2007, Fig 4 and 6, Region C).ConclusionThe objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).ReferencesBeck, C., & Shennan, S., 1991.

Flange-twisted gold bar torc: complete and slender, with round-sectioned hooked terminals. Tightly coiled seven and a half times, probably to fit into the pot. Slightly gouged, probably through recent plough disturbance.2. Twisted gold wire bracelet: small and complete, comprising six twisted wires. Angular flat ended rectangular terminals, enclosing and securing wire ends. At intervals, there are joins between wires (possible soldered). Tightly coiled in flat coil form, probably to fit into pot. (Fig.XX)3. Composite gold necklace pendant: round bead attached to a biconical shaped body. The body is made of circular sectioned wire, spiralled around in many coils and probably soldered together to form a hollow pendant. Wire from pendant drawn up and welded to bead. Wearing facets on the bead and the pendant top surface suggest it was once the centrepiece of a strung bead necklace. (Fig.XX)4. Penannular gold ring: C-sectioned sheet, with rounded convex exterior surface and concave interior. Simple terminals.5. Corrugated&nbsp;gold tripartite penannular ring: sheet, with triple ribs defined by two grooves. Simple terminals, pressed together and overlapping.6. Composite gold tripartite penannular ring: formed of three round-sectioned wires, fused together. Simple clipped or cut terminals.7. Round gold bead: small, hollow, thin sheet bead.8. Biconical gold bead: thin, hollow, sheet bead with oval shaped apertures, slightly dented.9. Biconical gold bead: thin, hollow, sheet bead with oval shape apertures, dented and with tear diagonally down mid-body wall.10. Biconical gold bead: thin, hollow, sheet bead with oval shaped apertures, slightly dented.11. Transitional bronze palstave: complete, narrow-bladed looped palstave with sides diverging slightly to an unexpanded blade edge. Median ridge on both faces, descending below the stop. Extensive surface pock-marking and erosion of original surfaces.12. Transitional bronze palstave: complete, similar in form to (11). Badly eroded flanges and extensive surface pock-marking and erosion of original surfaces.13. Trunnion tool (chisel) of bronze: straight-sided chisel, with pointed butt end, diverging to an unexpanded crescentic blade edge. Lateral trunnions or lugs, one highly eroded. Pitted and eroded.14. Half base sherd from a hand-made pottery vessel of later prehistoric technology. Lack of body form, rim and decoration precludes precise dating on stylistic grounds. Old upper wall breaks, fresh break across centre of base.Discussion: Soon after the reporting of this hoard, the find-spot was visited by two of the authors (ML and AG) and Nick Herepath, Finds Liaison Officer based at Liverpool Museum (to whom the finders had originally taken the hoard for safe-keeping). With the assistance of the finders, the precise location of the hoard was accurately tied into the Ordnance Survey grid. A test pit (1.5 by 1.5m) was hand-excavated directly over the discovery focus, revealing a number of inter-cutting detector pits. The ploughsoil was found to be around 0.30m deep, directly overlying subsoil. No further artefacts and no archaeological features were located. Recent ploughing had probably disturbed and scattered the hoard, the bracelet being dragged up-field some metres before being dropped by the plough.The Burton Hoard may be dated to the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150 BC) by the range of chronologically diagnostic artefact forms present. This is an exceptional and extremely varied group of gold adornments and bronze tools representing one of the most important gold-bronze associations of the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain. At this time, a distinctive tradition involving the skilled twisting of gold torcs, worn as neck ornaments or armlets, emerged and flourished across Atlantic Europe. This was complemented by new found soldering and spiralling decorative techniques, witnessed here on the twisted wire bracelet and the composite necklace pendant. These are extremely rare forms, the bracelet only finding parallel with a ring and neck ornament in the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc Hoard (Ille-et-Vilaine, France). The pendant is only paralleled by a very recent 2005 discovery from West Sussex, currently going through the treasure process (2005 T421).These artefacts may have been the possessions of a single person of some standing, either within a wealthy farming community and/or perhaps tied into the network of copper, tin and gold exchanges between western Britain and Ireland of the time. The coiling of the torc and bracelet, before placing it into the pot indicates care taken in burial, which could have been a votive act or a burial by proxy, the body of the owner being disposed of separately. No settlements or burial monuments are known in the vicinity of this low-lying and periodically flooding burial place, near the River Alyn. It appears that riverside locations were commonly selected, in north east Wales and Cheshire, as appropriate places for the burial of gold artefacts and hoards. Rivers seem to have exerted deep symbolic significance to these prehistoric farming and metal-working communities.

The knife is near complete with the tang and most of the blade surviving in relatively good condition. The tip of the knife blade is lost due to an old, but unpatinated break. The knife is bent below the mid point across the upper blade, the bend is at an angle and a large scar / fracture in the metalwork is present at this point. This damage is likely to be as a result of movement in the plough soil. For this reason the knife is probably relatively unstable and liable to further deterioration over time, especially if stored in less than ideal conditions.The knife is irregular in plan with the long edges tapering from a mid point. The cross section is irregular being broadly rectangular. The tang is slight with the butt end being relatively thin rounded and damaged by movement. From this narrow butt the tang expands and thickens; the expansion is irregular and the two long edges flare unevenly. At the widest point of the tang the edges are stepped outwards to meet the upper edge of the hilt of the blade. This is seen clearly on one edge whilst the other is poorly preserved. From this widest point the upper blade tapers from the hilt evenly and regularly. The long edges are slightly bevelled, this is best shown on the poorly preserved edge below the area of major damage - here the cutting edge / blade bevel seems to have been ground on one edge only. The profile of the knife is very flat, especially the blade. An ogival arc formed of differential corrosion is present on both faces at the junction between blade and tang - this arc is formed from the differential corrosion caused by an organic / wood or bone hilt. The area of damage on one part of the blade edge is from lateral movement in the soil. The artefact has a mid green colour and polished patina, this has been abraded in several places and the surface is corroded a mid purple brown colour. A light green blue powdery active surface corrosion product is present in some places, specifically in areas of modern damage. A mid brown coloured stain is also present on one face of the artefact; this possibly an iron pan within the soil matrix. Faint longitudinal striation marks are present on the blade whilst diagonal marks are evident on the tang - the age of these marks is uncertain - although some appear to be patinated suggesting some age.The knife measures; 110.5mm length, 38.6mm wide and 2.2mm thick across the hilt plate, and 17.6mm wide and 1.6mm thick across the broken blade. The knife weighs 29.95 gramsThe metallic composition of the knife has been analysed by Dr Eleanor Blakelock, Birmingham Museums Trust. Her report is produced below:X-ray florescence analysis was undertaken on the surface of the objects using a Bruker M1 Mistral desktop XRF in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery conservation laboratory. The results suggests that the dagger/knife is an arsenical-antinomy bronze with c. 89-91% Copper (Cu), 5-7% Arsenic (As), 2-4% Antimony (Sb), and 0.3-0.6% lead (Pb). This composition is typical for an Early Bronze Age date. The analysis however was carried out on the surface of the corroded object therefore the results may not be entirely representative of the core alloy of the dagger/knife.The knife is best classified using Needham's 7 series typology ( 2015) as Series I A. being a tanged knife with flat blade and no rivets dated 2450/2400 BC - 2300 cal BC. This fits within Needham (1996) period I Chalcolithic / Earliest Bronze Age / metal using Neolithic. There are less than 50 known examples from Britain known at the time of writing (2015) with Gerloff (1975) identifying 24 in her corpus and Needham (2015) listing an additional 16. PAS has a further four examples (including this one) within its database. A good parallel can be seen in the dagger / knife excavated with the Amesbury Archer (Needham 2011 Grave 1289 / ON6613). These daggers are closely linked with burial in 'Beaker' period graves. The findspot of this 'Newport' example lies close to the remains of a ploughed out round barrow and potentially indicates the presence of a flat cemetery / urn field in the immediate area of the mound. The use of copper daggers and knives is a European phenomena associated with the 'Beaker period (Case 2004: 25-26). These artefacts are of the same period as barbed and tanged arrowheads, stone wrist guards and gold sheet metal ornaments. The other examples recorded on the PAS database are:Silverdale, Lancaster (LANCUM-3BEC10)Witton Gilbert, County Durham (NCL-093B77)Clanfield, Oxfordshire (SUR-38BFA5)Sincere thanks is extended to Dr. Stuart Needham for his help, advice and dated parallels and Dr Eleanor Blakelock and Birmingham Museum Trust for undertaking the analysis of this important find.ReferencesCase, H. 2004 'Beakers and Beaker culture' in Czebreszuk J.

This appears to be a single find as at near Birghstone&#39;, Isle of Wight (IOW-1F5D46). Similar finds are also known threaded on twisted torcs as from Haxey, Lincolnshire (Eogan 1994, 59, fig. 22, no. 1) and threaded onto a penannular bracelet as with the Stretham hoard, Cambridgeshire (Eogan 1994, 59, fig. 21, no. 4) and north-east Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2004, 22, no. 6). Conclusion As it was found before 1997 this falls under the Treasure Trove Act; where evidence would have to point to the object having been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery. The penannular ring is most likely to be a casual loss, therefore does not constitute treasure.

A third tube-shaped sheet (once around 9.5mm in height) defines the wall of the inner circular-shaped opening and is folded over the margins of the face-plates. The terminals defining the slot are triangular shaped in cross-section and are open.Semi-quantitative surface analysis of the lock-ring indicated a composition of 86-87% gold, 8-10% silver and 3-5% copper. This single discovery extends the known distribution of lock-rings into coastal west Wales. Other discoveries of lock-rings within hoards have previously been made at Gaerwen, Anglesey and at the Pigeon's Cave on the Great Orme, Conwy, both along the northern coast of Wales. Together with particular forms of gold bracelet, these have previously suggested a possible Late Bronze Age exchange route with Ireland. The combination of constructional and stylistic features on this Newport example does not easily fit within the existing regional sub-groupings of lock-rings across Britain. The mix of both northern British and southern British attributes on this example hints at a previously unsuspected diversity of technique and cultural expression.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-03T00:00:00Z,,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,"Restricted access",Newport,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","National Museum Wales - Amgueddfa Cymru - Cardiff",320484,images/mlodwick/,0904.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMGW,2010-12-10T12:10:38Z,2017-03-01T14:10:32Z

There is damage around three of the attachment hole which could be a sign of ware.Sheridan et al (2002 p 816) suggest that the arrangement of spacer bead ornaments appear to copy that of Irish gold lineal ornaments in their crescent shape. In a personal comment Catherine Frieman from the University of Nottingham, suggests that this could be the only known example of this type of bead from south east England. The closest known examples are from East Anglia and Wiltshire.The bead is 44.7mm long, 26.2mm wide, 6.6mm thick and weighs 5.6 grams.Sheridan A, Davis, Clark and Redvers Jones, 2002.

This example fits best into the earliest known copper axe and early bronze axes discovered in Britain. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC.The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The overall length is 90.0mm and the axe weighs 133.45 grams. It should be noted that the axe is relatively small when compared to the corpus of known Early Bronze Age material. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 19.8mm (thickness: 2.8mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge). However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (8.2mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 51.6mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present; it has been lost through abrasion. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. However, almost all of the original patina has been lost through laminating corrosion. Where a large segment of original patina remains on one face there is no discernable patterning. The axe is a mid green brown colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present. The overall condition of the axe suggests that there has been a relatively large amount of movement in the soil. The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.",1,"County / local importance",,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"West Midlands","County of Herefordshire","County of Herefordshire","Restricted access",Ledbury,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder",,281986,images/preavill/,HESH-ACD6C1.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,HESH,2010-05-12T16:46:52Z,2016-09-27T12:45:36Z

The terminals are joined but there is a fracture between the two sides (giving the object an overall width of 76.9mm). The terminals are circular but are irregular (with a diameter of 40mm) and are angled upwards towards the midpoint. The underside of the terminals have a crescent-shaped bevel on the outer edges, elsewhere the underside is concave and appears unfinished from casting. At the centre of each terminal are raised stubs around a rectangular depression (5.3mm long by 1.3mm wide), presumably the remnants of where the jet was removed, although it remains uncertain why the casting left rectangular depressions. The upper faces of the terminals have a raised edge defined by an internal groove. The finished edge does not continue onto the inner side of the terminals. The faces are convex, growing deeper towards the hoop (with a thickness of 6mm). There is a semicircular moulding around the hoop on both terminals (19mm long, 15mm wide and 1mm deep). The hoop (with a maximum external width of 60.2mm and internal: 44.1mm wide by 29.7mm high) is of oval section and is widest and deeper near the terminals (at 14mm wide and 9mm deep) and narrows to the midpoint of the hoop (7mm wide and 7mm deep). There are no discernible wear facets around the hoop. The inner face of the hoop has a casting flaw near one terminal, resulting from an air bubble. The surface of the copper alloy is pitted with a mid-brown patina and a silvery sheen, probably because of tin leaching, leading to surface enrichment.",1,,"Analysis to ascertain the metallurgical composition of the bronze was attempted using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were taken from the surface and initial results appear to have been effected by the tin leaching referred to above, resulting in very high tin readings. Unusually, there was no lead detected in the readings. The ring appears to be unfinished on the terminals and any identification is somewhat speculative. The form of the artefact closely resembles &#39;dress-fasteners&#39;, particularly if the terminals were finished and separated to form a penannular ring. Dress-fasteners are of Late Bronze Age date, generally associated with the Ewart Park and Llyn Fawr metalworking industry, corresponding to Needham&#39;s (1996) Periods 7 and 8, dated to c. 950-750BC and 750-450BC respectively. Dress-fasteners are of uncertain function, and are generally made of gold and recovered from Ireland and Scotland, with outliers from Yorkshire and Norfolk (Eogan 1994, p 98, fig 40) . Bronze examples are occasionally recovered, such as in the Mountrivers Hoard, County Cork, Ireland (Eogan, 1994, Plate XVI) and the Poolewe Hoard, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland (Schmidt &amp; Burgess, plate 152) .

It was originally created from a rectangular bar like ingot which has been hammered and manipulated to create the form. The body of the bracelet has a relatively thin rectangular section which is best described as a ribbon-like; and the two parallel long edges taper evenly from the break and are relatively robust being slightly thickened / hammer shaped. As the sides rapidly taper but they then expand slightly to form a funnel like expanded cylindrical terminal. The terminal is ?sub-square shaped in section and is folded back upon itself onto the body in a U shape. The break on the body is irregular and raggedy; possibly as a result of modern agricultural activity / ploughing. There is no sign of incised or applied decoration present on any surface. The profile of the bracelet strongly suggests that at one point it had been folded or poorly rolled into a smaller shape ? possibly indicating that it had been due to be recycled or more likely be put beyond use as a ritual deposited. The findspot supports this later argument being discovered in an area which was historically waterlogged with significant areas of braded streamlets associated with the water catchment of both the rivers Frome and Loden. The form of this gold work can be closely paralleled with a hoard of similarly folded gold torcs from the Ellesborough Area, Buckinghamshire (Roberts & Tyrell 2009), a similar but much larger hoard from Priddy in the Mendip Hills Somerset (Minnitt et al 2007), and three twisted gold ribbon torcs with hooked terminals from Cwmjenkin Farm, Heyhope in Powys which were tangled together and crumpled into a ball (Savory 1980, 126). There are also two further Middle Bronze Age flat bronze ribbon torcs known from Somerset from the hoards at Edington Burtle and Wedmore (Inventaria Archaeologica GB, 44, 2: 1-2; Eogan 1983, 124-125). The distribution of this form from the parallels above suggests a strong south western British pattern which somewhat echoes the distribution outlined by Eogan (ibid). Dating of all these artefacts is achieved purely on their simple stylised form and the plain bar-hooked terminals: all of these strongly suggest a Middle Bronze Age date (following: Taylor 1980, 63 & plate 42d) with it being suggested that the Priddy Hoard specifically dates to the period circa 1300 ? 1100 BC (Minnitt et al 2007)ReferencesBasford, F 2014: A gold bracelet fragment from fresh Water, Isle of Wight (IOW-0195D2).

One terminal survives, while the other has been torn around 4-7mm from the end. The surviving terminal is loosely folded over, with an external width of 3.5-5mm. The terminal tapers gradually beyond the fold-over, with a flat but slightly convex shaped end and rounded corners. An offset crease, parallel to the terminal-end is visible 2.2-2.5mm from the edge, the strip terminal also being pinched and thinned beyond the crease. Approximately 4mm from the terminal, a pin-hole approximately 0.8mm in diameter perforates the strip. Denting on the underside or interior of the fold-over indicates the pin was pressed from the current exterior side, though small projecting margin rings of excess gold are visible on both margin surfaces. A scrape next to the perforation was probably made in error with the same fine pin at the time the perforations were made.The opposite terminal looks to be starting to taper, near the point of the tear. One torn corner has folded over since breakage. This terminal has two perforations, each approximately 0.8mm in diameter. One perforation is approximately 2.2mm from the torn end, while the tear has bisected the second perforation. Denting on one surface indicates the pin was pressed from the same side as the perforation on the other terminal, and projecting margin rings of excess gold are visible on both surface margins. The end 12mm of the strip exhibits prominent sinuous bending at right angles to the long-axis of the strip. At one time, this was probably bent over, similarly to the other terminal.At the mid-point along the strip is a band, indicating a point at which the strip was once folded around a larger object, itself around 20-25mm wide. This folding point is evidenced on the interior side by a localised change in the surface gold texture and delimited by linear changes of surface contour around 3.5mm apart. On the exterior surface, there is slight evidence for lines of bending of the gold in the same place. The strip edge on one side also looks to be distorted at this point.The strip looks to have been hammer-shaped, with small surface facets, pressed ridged folds and slight localised variations in the strip-width.

It is unclear if the differing ring size has any significance; their location on the bracelet cannot be used for any interpretation as one of the rings was found separately and reattached to the bracelet by the finder.DiscussionComposite rings have been found singly and associated with other gold personal ornaments. They may also be found linked together. In Britain they may be dated by association to the Middle Bronze Age. In common with some other gold ornament types they are also found in Ireland and France though they appear to be rarer in Ireland. At Stretham, Cambridgeshire six composite rings were found threaded onto a penannular bracelet; a twisted neck ornament and a bronze rapier were found in association. A Treasure find from North East Norfolk (2004T81) comprised a plain loop of thick gold wire threaded with seven composite and two simple rings.The best parallels for the double-stranded ornament are in the Middle Bronze Age Beerhackett (Dorset) hoard (which included one with a twisted body as well as a plain one) and another with a twisted body from Cross near Axminster, Devon. The French and Central European double-stranded coils all have plain, untwisted bodies.The continental examples are all made on fairly slender gold wire and soldered at the ends to create loops, except for one from Heidolsheim (Bas-Rhin) where the wire is thicker and the free ends are twisted together, the whole then folded in two and coiled (Elu&egrave;re 1982, 34). Scientific examination of the Windsor example revealed the presence of solder on both the twisted ornaments and the rings. Further study might indicate the position of any joins.Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Gillian VarndellThe British MuseumReference: C Elu&egrave;re 1982.

It is also possible that they were worn as bracelets because, at the point the ribbon is doubled, the width tapers and a loop is formed to receive the hooks.The lengths of the Ellesborough objects are similar to the Mendip Hills bracelets, however the former weighs more than double the latter. There are potential parallels in the gold hooked strip found at Winterhay Green, Somerset perhaps crumpled together with other similar strips though these are now sadly lost (Evans 1881, 90; Eogan 1983, 126). Three twisted gold ribbon torcs with hooked terminals were also found at Cwmjenkin Farm, Heyhope in Powys tangled together and crumpled into a ball. These are however, far heavier than the flat ribbon bracelets from Ellesborough (Savory 1980, 126). In addition, there are also two Middle Bronze Age flat bronze ribbon torcs known from Somerset from the hoards at Edington Burtle and Wedmore (Inventaria Archaeologica GB, 44, 2 (1-2); Eogan 1983, 124-125). It should also be noted that, as well as the form, the simple bar-hooked terminals also suggest a Middle Bronze Age date (Taylor 1980, 63 (pls. 42d).The location of this gold hoard in Buckinghamshire is consistent with previous finds of Middle Bronze Age ornament hoards in the broader area (see Roberts 2007, Fig 6) such as the two gold flange twisted torcs and three gold penannular bracelets found at Crow Down, Lambourn Berkshire (Varndell et al. 2007).ConclusionThese can be considered as potential Treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act.ReferencesEogan, G. 1983.

It is likely that this axe is complete with a distinctive flat butt; it is also very heavy for its size. This example fits best into the copper axes and early bronze axes These are dated to the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC.The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The overall length is 115.5mm and the axe weighs approximately 450 grams. The butt is relatively thin having a wide flat edge; the width at the butt is 39.5mm (thickness: 3.5mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge). However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (13.5mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 68.5mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. The axe is a mid green brown colour with a much abraded or corroded patina. Where damage has occurred there is either a light green active corrosion or a mid brown purple coloured corrosion present. The overall condition of the axe suggests that there has been limited movement in the soil.The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age (or possibly even the Copper Age). The form of the axe is comparable to Type Growtown/ Milton Moss (outlined by Schmidt and Burgess p 23-24). This form is described as having a thin butt, relatively straight sides with slightly expanded cutting edge. These have a broad distribution in Wales and the Marches but are also common in England. However, this axe also has characteristics seen on other forms of early axes specifically Type Lough Ravel / Minto and some of the early Migdale axes (although these tend to have narrower butts which flare more at the cutting edge). These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.Note - Peter Reavill - 18/5/21.Thanks are extended to Dr Brendan O'Connor who has suggested that this axe form is now better understood after the recent publication of Stuart Needham 2017: The Classification of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age Copper and Bronze Axe-head from Souther Britain.This axe should therefore be reassigned to the thin-butted copper axes which are used to exemplify his Class 2B, Type Lode, with a date in the 24th century (Needham 2017, illustrated on p 47 no 8, details on p 67)",1,"Regional importance",,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"West Midlands",Worcestershire,"Malvern Hills","Restricted access","Malvern Hills",,"Restricted access",,,,,,,,232570,images/preavill/,HESH-84D8A5.jpg,"Restricted info","Other chance find",,HESH,2009-07-23T12:50:32Z,2021-05-18T12:03:33Z

This example may represent the transition between solid gold and foil construction, therefore as a potentially early example of a 'hair-ring', could date to as early as the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). Semi-quantitative analysis of the ring indicates a very high gold composition, with a small percentage of silver and 1% copper. The ring was found in the lower fill of a ditch at the periphery of a settlement, providing important dating evidence for its occupation during the Later Bronze Age.",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-09-30T23:00:00Z,,Wales,"Isle of Anglesey","Isle of Anglesey","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder",,,291042,images/mlodwick/,"Trearddur 2007 07.23a.JPG","Restricted info","Controlled archaeological investigation (stratified)",,NMGW,2009-01-23T11:45:27Z,2017-09-12T11:40:27Z

In parts of Essex this process created the indurated conglomerate used as a building material in churches (Turner 1988). It is evident from this homogenous and distinctive surface discoloration of the items reported here that they have a shared history, one best explained as deposition together as a hoard.Hoard Catalogueartefacts1. Fragment of sword blade. Copper-alloy. The section is lozenge-shaped with very narrow blade edges. When it was broken into scrap metal it was left with more or less straight edges running at right angles across the blade. Length 32.6 millimetres; width 44.3 millimetres; depth 8.3 millimetres; weight 47.24 grammes.2. Fragment of sword blade. Copper-alloy. The section is a shallow lentoid with narrow blade edges. When it was broken into scrap metal it was left with more or less straight edges running at right angles across the blade. Length 32.1 millimetres; width 47.1 millimetres; depth 5 millimetres; weight 35.57 grammes.3. Fragment of socketed tongue chape (a chape is the terminal of a sword scabbard). Copper-alloy. Both sides have a prominent longitudinal central rib rising from gently concave faces which terminate in a flanged edge. The lower end of the chape is solid but the termination of the socket is apparent at the other (upper) end. The outer edges descend towards the (missing) end in a gentle concave curve. On one face there is a large straight removal of metal from the outer surface of the socket. Length 45.5 millimetres; width 34.3 millimetres; depth 10.4 millimetres; weight 28.73 grammes.4. Fragment of socketed spear blade. Copper-alloy. The deep socketed midrib rises from a wing with a straight upper edge (at the tip end of the weapon), giving way to a curved edge towards the lower end of the fragment. The curved socketed midrib had been bent out of true when the item was broken up for scrap. At the same time, the blade was fractured in such a way that the breaks across both ends run more or less at right angles across the artefact. Bearing in mind the configuration of the piece, the original was a evidently a long and slender weapon. Length 63.9 millimetres; width 29.7 millimetres; depth 9.6 millimetres; weight 27.62 grammes.5. Fragment of socketed spear blade. Copper-alloy. Enough of the midrib survives to show that it was socketed. One the one side where it is present, a slight bevel separates the narrow wing from the midrib. When the blade was broken up for scrap, the breaks across both ends ran more or less at right angles across the artefact. Length 44.8 millimetres; width 17.1 millimetres; depth 6.4 millimetres; weight 16.06 grammes.6. Fragment of tubular spear ferrule (a ferrule is a cap fitted to the end of a spear). Copper-alloy. The item is part of the upper end of a tubular ferrule; the original top edge is present. When it was broken into scrap the tube was bent slightly out of true, making it hazardous to try and gauge the original diameter. Length 68.2 millimetres; width 21 millimetres; depth 6.4 millimetres; weight 17.56 grammes.Hoard Catalogueflat plate scrapThe plate scrap in the hoard is listed below. Its homogeneity is such that a detailed description of each individual piece would be inappropriate here, but a few general observations can be made. There are 31 fragments weighing 1.039.63 grammes, with an average fragment weight of 33.5 grammes. Fragment weights range from 13.16 to 62.51 grammes. Each piece is more or less flat, and ranges in thickness from 2.5 to 6.3 millimetres with an average thickness of 3.5 millimetres. No piece has the ribbing found on other finds of this plate scrap (Burgess 1969,fig.9 no.10, 37). Some pieces have chamfered edges (Fragment 31) but it is difficult to gauge if the edge in question was original. In one case (Fragment 30) the plate continues beyond the chamfer as a thinner sheet of metal. In at least two cases some of the original edge is present (Fragments 32-33). It is rounded in section and best described as sinuous, lobbed or curved in outline. No joins could be found in the material. The dearth of original finished edges gives the impression of scrap that had been detached from a much larger plate or plates.Plate scrap of this kind is a component of Wilburton period hoards from Britain and the mainland of Europe (Burgess 1969, 37), but it is never common. Its is present in the County Roscommon (Republic of Ireland) hoard but as the hoard is unique for Ireland there is a possibility that it might be a modern import from overseas (Eogan 1983, 49).7.

Length 46.4 millimetres; width 25.2 millimetres; 6.3 millimetres thick; weight 31.25 grammes. This fragment differs in some respects from the other plate scrap fragments. It is thicker and the surfaces are less even, with a generally more irregular appearance. Although a Bronze Age date cannot be precluded, it has not been included in the total hoard weight or any other quantified data on the composition of the hoard.An Interpretation of the FindsThe items reported here bear every appearance of material that had been broken up for scrap metal.Casual losses of Bronze Age metalwork on the scale seen here are unknown. When bronze items are found on a contemporary settlement site, they are invariably tiny fragments of artefacts that had been overlooked or lost by accident (Needham 1980, 24-5).Most metalwork in the Bronze Age was recycled for new tools and that accounts for the rarity of metal on settlements.Bearing in mind the relatively large size of the fragments and the way in which they had been broken up for scrap (fractures at right angles to blades), there is every likelihood that they represent a small hoard of metalwork that had been disturbed since antiquity and dispersed in plough soil.Hoard WeightThe 31 items in the hoard weight 1,212.41 grammes, with an average item weight of 32.76 grammes. More details are given in the Table. It should be borne in mind that the weights were taken before conservation of the hoard and that different weights may emerge after treatment of the finds. Dr M.G. Spratling pointed out to me that the plate scrap fragments are almost exactly six times the weight of the weapon fragments. If that is not coincidence, it suggests the hoard has been recovered in its entirety. An appendix by Dr M.G. Spratling below has some further observations on the metrology of the hoard.number of items weight average weight weaponry 6 172.78g 28.78g Plate fragments 31 1,039.63g 33.53g totals 37 1,212.41 32.76gComposition of the HoardDateThe key finds for dating the hoard are the fragments of plate scrap and the chape. Plate scrap of the kind found is typical of the Wilburton phase of late Bronze Age metalwork (Burgess 1969, 37), now dated c. 1140-1020 (Needham et al. 1998, 82, 90). The tongue-shaped sword chape is another diagnostic Wilburton artefact (O'Connor 1980, 146-7 his lozenge-section chape). Although the other material in the hoard is not exclusive to the Wilburton tradition, it can all be readily accommodated in a Wilburton context.A Characterisation of the HoardThe Hoard is a collection of scrap metal that had been destined for recycling in the Bronze Age to make new artefacts. It is dominated by thirty-one fragments of plate ingot. The only artefacts represented by its scrap metal are weaponry - a sword, spear and ferrule.The Status of the Find as Potential TreasureThe items reported here were associated, found in the same place at the same time.This is a collection of prehistoric copper-alloy metalwork that constitutes a hoard, more than 300 years old.As such, there is a prima facie case for considering the find to be treasure, as defined in law.An Archaeological Commentary on the HoardThe great majority of the Bronze Age metalwork hoards discovered in Essex are late Bronze Age (Sealey 1988, 12), and of those nearly all belong to the c. 1020-800 BC Ewart Park phase. As we have seen, 2008 T589 belongs to the preceding c. 1140-1020 BC Wilburton phase of the late Bronze Age. Wilburton material is rare in Essex, and there is only one other hoard. This other hoard is a small cache of two razors and a sword broken into four fragments found only seven kilometres west of 2008 T589 (Piggott 1946, 126, fig.8, 138 nos 44-5; Jockenhvel 1980, 78 nos 222-3, Taf.13; Colquhoun and Burgess 1988, 41 no.148, 43, pls 25 and 144 no.148).The other hoard provides the earliest context for heel-shaped razors in the British Isles, and this led Needham (1980, 20) to raise the possibility that its Wilburton sword might be a scrap survival in a hoard buried in the Ewart Park phase. In other words, 2008 T589 is our first unequivocal Wilburton hoard from Essex. As such, the hoard is a statement of unique importance about how warfare was conducted in the county at the end of the second millennium BC.The plate ingot fragments that dominate the hard are rare finds. There were sixteen fragments in the County Roscommon (Republic of Ireland) hoard (Eogan 1983, 49, 325 nos 20-21), and seventeen from the Syon Reach (London) hoard (Needham and Burgess 1980, 443, 445; Needham 1987, 120, fig.5.15 nos 4-18; Cotton and Green 2005, fig.12 nos 4-18 & 31). With thirty-one pieces, 2008 T589 is the largest collection of such fragments from the British Isles.2008 T589 is a hoard of some significance, and it is to be hoped that it is eventually acquired by a public museum for further research and more detailed recording.AuthorshipThis report was completed in June 2009 by Dr Paul R. Sealey, Curator of Archaeology at Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service.Appendix. Observations on the Metrology of 2008 T589By Dr M.G. SpratlingThe find consists of thirty-seven items, six of them weaponry, the rest of them fragments of plate scrap. All are fragmentary.Weight of the weaponry: 172.78g (wn) Weight of the plate scrap: 1039.63g (pl)Total weight: 1212.41g (to)Average weight of the weaponry: 28.80g Average weight of the plate scrap: 33.54g Average weight of all fragments: 32.77gProportions in the weights and average weights:wn : pl 1 : 6 thus, wn : to 1 : 7 pl : to 6 : 7 average wn : average pl 6 : 7Accuracy of weighing:1. wn x 6 is 1036.68g, 2.95g short of pl (1039.63g), thus 0.28% out, or accurate to 1 part in 357 (1 : 360, in round numbers)2. pl  6 is 173.27g, 0.49g more then wn (172.78g); the accuracy is the same as in 1.3. average wn x 7/6 is 33.6g, 0.06g more than average pl (33.54g), thus 0.18% out, or accurate to 1 part in 556 (1 : 560, in round numbers).CommentsIt is quite evident that a balance was used to select the items in this deposit.The accuracy is reasonably good by Late Bronze Age standards; in gold hoards we often find accuracy as good as 1 : 1000Without some external indicator we cannot discern whether the weight of the weaponry is in error or that of the plates scrap; at present the only indicator I have (I really need two or three) comes from the two-part gold hoard I from Downpatrick (County Down in Ulster) which in its entirety weighs 1037.98g (1.65g less than wn) which looks likely to be about right (so both pl and wn may be slightly wrong).Dr Mansel G.

In plan, the axe has concave sides, a convex cutting edge and a mouth with a rounded collar with a single moulding below it. The end of the mouth is not flat; there are two crests at about the central point on either face. There is a loop on the haft end of one side of the body. When viewed in profile, the axe can be seen to be broadly triangular in shape, with the front and reverse faces being slightly convex. The mouth of the axe is sub-square with rounded corners, almost circular, although towards the cutting edge the socket and the axe are rectangular in section. The socket extends approximately 62mm into the axe. There is a plug of earth within the socket which can be freely removed. Two ridges run down the upper portion of the socket, at about the centre of the front and reverse of the axe. A casting seam runs down both sides of the axe. There are some slightly raised areas on the surface of the axe with a lustrous smooth brown patina. But generally the axe has a slightly pitted brown surface, with a few small areas where green corrosion products are visible. There are transverse grooves/striations and some crazing visible on the surface of the lower blade, particularly on one face of the axe. There is a slight depression on both faces on the body of the axe. The cutting edge is complete and remains sharp. There is a small amount of recent damage on the collar and edge of one face where the surface has been removed revealing the yellow/gold colour of the metal. The axe is in excellent condition overall. The axe is 98.9mm long. The cutting edge is 39.8mm wide and the mouth is 36.6mm from side to side, and 35.3mmm from front to back (maximum external dimensions). The axe has a mass of 183.8g excluding the plug of soil in the socket. The axe recorded here is similar to south-eastern socketed axes identified by Scmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 212-6, and plate 85), particularly axes 1275-1279 which are Variant Bilton (described as Variant Worthing on Plate 85). Schmidt and Burgess (ibid, p. 212) comment that the south-eastern type of socketed axehead is, ""...characterized by a fairly slender, square to rectangular-sectioned body with a squarish mouth."" They explain that Variant Bilston/Worthing axes have long bodies with concave sides curving to an unexpanded cutting edge, and a mouth where a rounded collar has a single moulding set below it (ibid., p.214). South-eastern axes appear to date from the Ewart Park Phase (Ibid. p.216-7) and, ""...may not have survived much into the Llyfawr period"". (ibid. p.217).

No surface metal analysis was carried out but the precious metal content (gold) will be more than 10%.The lunula terminal was found whilst out metal-detecting on farmland near Brampton, Cumbria.The terminal (or 'horn') consists of a flat part which is shaped like the bowl of a spoon which is connected by a short 'stalk' to an elongated part with flat-rectangular cross-section which would have extended into the large, crescent-shaped collar. The bowl-shaped end is undecorated on both sides, but the strip displays a decoration of parallel lines on the obverse whilst being undecorated on the reverse. The lines are incised and were applied to run parallel to the sides of the fragment and along the top of the flattened part. They form roughly one half of a set of 'boxes'. The incised lines of the outermost 'box' have an additional decoration of very small squares which were applied with a small punch at irregular intervals over the incised line.The 'stalk' which connects the flat collar and bowl-shaped terminal has a round cross-section and is twisted at a 90 degree angle (as the other terminal or 'horn' would have been). This was necessary for the two terminals to interlock when the lunula was worn.Although common in Ireland, lunulae are very rare Bronze Age gold objects found in the British Isles and northwest France. They date from around 2200-1700BC and are thus c. 4000 years old.Only few are known from Scotland and this is the first lunula fragment from Cumbria. A small number have also been found in Cornwall and Brittany, France. In contrast to some of the Scottish lunulae and this new fragment from Brampton, original Irish lunulae were made from extremely thin gold sheet (less than 0.1mm thick). They are very fragile and much less substantial than these thicker lunulae which Taylor classified as 'Provincial type lunulae' (Taylor 1970, 74ff). Original Irish sheet lunulae were so thin that they could be rolled and folded (Cahill pers. comm.), but the new fragment from Brampton was, similar to the complete lunulae from Auchentaggart, (Dumfries, Scotland) and Orbliston (Elginshire, Scotland) (National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland: NMX.FE3 and NMX.FE2), made from a thicker sheet of gold.The two lunulae from Auchentaggart and Orbliston are the most useful parallels to our fragment from Brampton: Although, unlike ours, complete, the lunula from Auchentaggart displays a repair at one terminal and the lunula from Orbliston is missing the greater part of one terminal whilst the second has broken off. Both objects are very fragile and difficult to handle with the transition from terminal to collar being their weakest point and clearly prone to breaking. Interestingly, the broken-off terminal of the Orbliston lunula is of similar dimensions and weight (6.06g) to the new fragment from Brampton (6.86g). The two above-named lunulae also display a similar decoration to that of the fragment from Brampton which is not as clear and neat as the decoration on the original Irish lunulae. 'Provincial' lunulae are usually decorated with an untidy pattern of parallel lines and 'boxes', dotted with elongated, square and round punches making up lines, zigzag lines or bundles of short, incised lines). All decoration is geometrical and not figural. The decoration of Irish and Scottish (and now, Northern English) is sufficiently similar to assume that the Scottish and Northern English lunulae were copies of the original Irish ones.As far as we can tell from old find reports and museum records, most lunulae were found singly or, rarer, in pairs, deposited on their own or possibly in a box or pouch. They are usually complete, even though the terminals are broken off. Lunulae have not been found within clear grave or hoard contexts and are thus generally considered to be single depositions.",1,"National importance","The lunula terminal from Brampton, Cumbria, would therefore qualify as Treasure under two of the stipulated criteria of the Treasure Act: it is more than 300 years old and the precious metal content (in this case gold) exceeds 10%.",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"North West",Cumbria,Carlisle,"Restricted access",Brampton,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Landowner donated his share to Tullie House Museum",166916,images/dboughton/,THLunula1abc.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,LANCUM,2008-02-26T17:15:49Z,2017-12-05T19:15:54Z

The find did not appear to have any accompanying material though a pebble track heading in the general direction of the find had been ploughed out in living memory.Description of object1. Gold ribbon fragment. The object is a gold fragment of a parallel sided strip, or ribbon. One end is neatly broken forming a straight edge whilst on the other the corners have been rounded perhaps implying the original finish. The back is undecorated, while the front carries eleven very finely executed grooves aligned longitudinally.DiscussionThis object cannot be identified with total certainty, but similar multi-grooved ribbon ornaments of Bronze Age date and of varied sizes are known from north-west Europe; this provides the most likely cultural background. Narrow-ribbon ornaments from the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc hoard, Brittany, have fewer and correspondingly broader ribs/grooves (Elure 1982, 91 Fig 107). They are finer on an earring from Saint-Pre-en-Retz (Loire-Atlantique) (ibid. 1982, 53 Fig 63) and finer still on some Irish Bronze Age ornaments. Among the latter are examples in two important associations, from Saintjohns, Co Kildare, and Derrinboy, Co Offaly. The Derrinboy pieces have enhanced ribs along the long edges not present on the Ansley fragment (Eogan 1994, 63 Fig 27B plate XII). There have been several comparable fragments found recently in Britain at Fontmell Magma, Dorset (Treasure Report 2003, 16) and Flixton, North Yorkshire (Treasure Report 2003, 16) as well from The Hamel, Oxford (Palmer 1980). The latter was excavated from a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd millennium BC.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"West Midlands",Warwickshire,"North Warwickshire","Restricted access",Ansley,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Warwickshire Museum",161542,images/abolton/,WAW-C0C0B3.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,WAW,2007-11-15T09:07:15Z,2017-12-05T17:39:40Z

The ends of the tube turn outwards to form sides to the slot, and its top and bottom edges are bent outwards to grip the face-plates. The ends of the face-plates are probably bent over to slightly overlap the side-plates and hold them in position (this can be seen clearly at one of the edges, where the junction is not obscured or damaged). The face-plates are plain apart from very slight concentric corrugations. Where the face-plates meet at the outer rim, they overlap slightly to make the join. Where the gold sheet has lifted a core is visible. In fairly good condition; damaged near the slot where face- plates have lifted. One side-plate has lifted away but is probably complete; the other is still in place. A small area of the outer rim is crushed. Height of tube (=maximum thickness of object): 11.2 mm; max. internal diameter of tube (= internal diameter of object): 20 mm; maximum external diameter: 35.8 mm; weight: 7.04 g. 2 Lock-ring, closely similar to the above. One side-plate is obscured by dirt but it may be seen that the ends of the face-plates are bent in to secure the side-plate. The other side-plate has torn away but remains attached to the tube with which it is integral; there is a visible core. The face-plates have parted in one place at the rim and there are some modern scrapes on the interior surface of the tube. Height of tube: 11 mm; internal diameter of tube: 20 mm; maximum external diameter: 35.5 mm; weight: 6.87 g. 3 Lock-ring, similar to the above, except that the edges of the side-plates are bent out to grip the face-plates; the face-plates are plain, and there appears to be a binding strip at the outer edges of the face-plates; this takes the form of a round-sectioned wire closely fixed (soldered?) to the edge. Although slightly crushed and distorted there are no tears visible but it seems likely from the weight that there is no core (though there are some loose fragments rattling inside). Dirt obscures one of the face-plates. Height of tube (crushed): 9 mm; internal diameter of tube (crushed): 10.14 x 10.58 mm; external diameter: 31.5 mm (measured where least distorted): weight: 3.16 g. 4 Lock-ring fragment, about half, crushed and torn. Enough detail survives to tell that the tube ends turn out to grip the face-plate, and the face-plates are bent over to overlap the remaining side-plate. The face-plates are decorated with fine, close-set concentric ridges. The edges of the face-plates overlap slightly. Part of a core is visible. The tube is very torn and crushed, and the face-plates similarly damaged at the broken end. The remaining side-plate is slightly displaced and crumpled, but the dimensions are all fairly close to original. Height of tube: 9 mm; internal diameter of tube: 10.32 mm; maximum external diameter 31.5 mm; weight: 1.22 g. 5 Lock -ring fragment, about half, crushed and torn. The junction of the top and bottom edges of the tube and face-plates is too damaged to be able to discern the method of securing it, but the surviving side-plate does appear to be integral with the tube. The ends of the face-plates are bent over to overlap the side-plate and at the outer rim they overlap slightly. The face-plates are decorated in the same way as (4). There is a visible core. The tube is very crumpled and torn; the face-plates are crumpled in places and the surviving side-plate is slightly displaced and crushed. Maximum surviving dimensions: Height of tube: 10.02 mm; internal diameter of tube 10.4 mm; external diameter: 30.03 mm; weight: 1.35 g. 6 Lock-ring fragment, about half, crushed and with tube and side-plate absent; however enough detail remains to suggest that the ends of the face-plates had overlapped the side plates; the face-plates overlap slightly to join at the outer rim.

Round section, highly polished surface. Length: 27.7 mm; diameter: 3.0 - 3.2 mm; weight: 0.9 g 20 Bugle-shaped fitting. Ring-and-loop part of two-part fitting; complete but with some cracking. Sub-D-shaped ring hollow-cast with thick round to oval section. A staple-like loop with a rough sub-triangular section is appended to the flatter side. Underneath it is a long cast perforation in the ring wall, allowing the original clay core to be seen. A second, oval perforation pierces the inner wall of the ring diametrically opposite; this has a surface fill of light grey material. Length: 55.5 mm; width: 61.0 mm; breadth: 14.7 mm; breadth loop: 3.7 - 4.5 mm; weight: 73.4 g 21 Curved plate-like fragment, possible bugle-shaped fitting.

Biconical moulding below collar. A large area is missing from the mouth and upper blade from one side and face. At this point on the side, the metal is extremely thin and there is a casting fault in the form of an oval perforation, only part of which survives. There is also an elongated narrow oval perforation on one face. Expanded blade with slight blade tip hollows. Only a small section of the blade edge is intact and one blade tip is missing. Fine horizontal striations at the blade edge. Off-centre casting flashes and the ghost of casting flashes from a model that were not removed before moulding. Considerable copper-alloy corrosion products within the socket and on the faces, incorporating a body fragment which is almost certainly part of the chape (no. 35). Red/brown staining on one face. L: 85.2 mm; W. mouth: 42.1 mm; B. mouth: 40.8 mm; W. blade: 56.4 mm; weight: 204.1 g. 27 Socketed axe, possibly Type Everthorpe. Incomplete, lacking upper body and most of the loop. Expanded blade, developed blade tip hollows on both sides. The loop stump is low. At the break on the body there is the vestige of a possible lower mouth moulding. Crisp, rectangular-sectioned body.

L: 95.3 mm; W blade: 21.2 mm; Th. blade: 3.1 mm; weight: 19.5 g. 32 Bifid razor blade portion. Broad, heel-shaped blade and stump of the tang. There is both a notch and a central circular perforation in the blade. Both faces have two parallel ribs running longitudinally from the base of the blade to the notch, skirting to either side of the perforation. Edge bevel visible on one blade wing on one face only. Fine striations along the blade on both sides of each face. Areas of copper-alloy corrosion products and red/brown staining on both surfaces. L: 59.9 mm; W: 45.5 mm; Th: 1.7-2.9 mm; weight: 17.1 g. 33 Razor blade fragment. Fragment from the blade midrib. Two parallel central ribs on each face. The perforation may be present but is uncertain due to fractured edges. The shape of the blade is unknown due to extensive edge loss. Areas of red/brown staining on one surface. L: 46.5 mm; W: 22.9 mm; Th: 1.3-3.4 mm; weight: 4.8 g. 34 Spearhead blade fragment. Leaf-shaped blade, tapering midrib and eye-shaped socket section. Corrosion damage on blade edges. Hollow edge bevels 5.5mm from blade edge. Socket edge pushed in at break. L: 87.2 mm; W: 35.9 mm; Th. blade wings: 1.1-5.6 mm; weight: 40.2g. 35 Tongue chape fragment. Three joining lower body fragments including the &#39;button&#39; terminal. The body is of rhombic section, but with narrow flattened sides throughout its length. The applied oval button-stud is intact. Pale grey/brown clay fabric core remnant survives in the base of the socket for about 17.5 mm from the top of the button. The body fragment attached by corrosion products to axe no. 26 is almost certainly part of this chape. One of the fragments is slightly cracked and has copper-alloy corrosion products on its internal surface. L: 63.5 mm; button: 14.6 x 11.3 mm; wall thickness: 1.1-2.0 mm; weight: 16.2 g. 36 Ingot, pear-shaped. An asymmetric pear shape in plan, one end rounded, the other more pointed. It is plano-convex in section, but much of the convex face is flat and parallel with the other. Surfaces are partly smooth and undulating, but there are hollows possibly from trapped gas bubbles on the convex (under) face and a number of craggy, dross-like protrusions from the upper, otherwise flat face. There is a significant chunk of charcoal, 10 mm across, embedded in one side and perhaps tiny chips elsewhere. Length: 157 mm; width: 83 mm; maximum thickness: 19 mm; thickness (excluding protrusions): 14.5 mm; weight: 758.1 g 37 Pottery sherds. Twenty sherds from small to medium size (excluding several small chips) are all of a similar fabric, coloration and thickness and seem likely to belong to a single vessel. Most have weathered or worn edges and only two joins were found. Two sherds have the very base of the wall, but virtually no continuation into the base itself. Another has an eroded rounded edge which may represent a simple rim; the wall below is gently convex. Wall thickness: 9 - 12 mm; weight: 325.6 g 38 ?Refractory sherd: One sherd is of a different, finer fabric, seemingly mid grey throughout, and highly eroded. The fabric is suggestive of clay mould or crucible.

The object was found close to a Bronze Age knife considered in the same treasure report (2005 T299) as a Bronze Age hoard containing: a socketed axe, a cast copper-alloy ring and a gold disc. Dimensions: External diameter: 31mm; height 25mm; weight: 35.8 g. Metal content: Plated surface, 52-55% gold, 39-42% silver, the remainder copper.Description: The object is formed of a convex disc with a cylinder-shaped protuberance in the centre. The protuberance has a constriction in the uppermost third, ending in a rounded knob. Four equidistant, circular rivet holes have been cut into the circular disc. It looks to have a copper-alloy core which has been plated with a gold-alloy.Discussion: The circular gold disc found with the Bronze Age hoard (2005 T299) has four rivet holes which match the position of the rivet holes on the gold object. It is the same size as the gold object. The composition of the gold-alloy used to make the circular disc is also very similar to this object. It is therefore very probable that this object and the disc were attached to one another in antiquity and became separated when the hoard was disturbed by ploughing.I can find no close parallels for this object. The object is unlikely to be a shield boss. It does not resemble other known Bronze Age shield bosses. It is also unlikely that the back of a shield boss would have been covered with gold as the gold would not have been visible when it was attached to a shield. There is some resemblance between this object and the top piece of crowns of Iron Age or Roman date.Conclusion: This object and the gold disc (reported as part of the Treasure Report 2005 T299) were almost certainly attached to one other during antiquity. On the balance of probabilities therefore this object was once a part of a Bronze Age hoard and became separated from the hoard when it was disturbed by ploughing. As a result, although it is not possible to identify this object it qualifies as Treasure. It is more than 300 years old and there is a proven association with objects which have already been declared Treasure.Jody Joy, Curator of Iron Age Collections,20th March 2007.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-11-13T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Essex,Brentwood,"Restricted access","Mid Essex",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Chelmsford Museum",318287,images/lmclean/,2006T562c.JPG,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,ESS,2007-09-06T15:48:22Z,2011-05-12T12:19:00Z

Well-dated types place the date of deposition at circa 1300-1100 BC, ie during or slightly after the Penard phase. It is likely that these are finger-rings. Loose spiral rings of the same date are known, eg from Axholme, Lincs. (threaded onto a twisted neck ornament along with two &#39;composite&#39; gold rings). The Axholme example appears to have a similar cross-section to the Takeley piece but is solid. Similar pieces are known from Ireland and northern France.

These are roughly circular piercings with evidence for rotational action in their formation; the tiny lips of metal pushed through to the reverse have been crudely doubled back and flattened. There is no evidence for decoration. The strip has many transverse creases consistent with it having been rolled up and crushed flat (see above circumstances). The main additional damage is a repeating pattern of rounded hammer dents of varied sizes and shapes; the faithful repetition of the pattern at regular intervals along the strip shows that they were inflicted after the object had been coiled and flattened and were hence transmitted through several thicknesses of sheet metal.",,,"Initially this would have been a very plain gold strip, swelling towards the middle. If the ends had been drawn close together before being secured using the perforations, it would have had a diameter of about 15 cm, a size suitable for a diadem or neck choker. In either case it could have been fixed to another material such as leather.Such plain ornaments lacking any archaeological context present problems for dating. Very few parallels can be found. Perhaps closest is a gold strip of similar shape, but more rounded ends and only 285 mm long, from Co Cavan, Ireland (Taylor 1980, pl. 28 g,h & i). It is, however, decorated with lightly incised lines and dots, a familiar feature of the earliest goldwork of western Europe. A bronze strip from an Early Bronze Age grave at Garton Slack, East Yorkshire, is generally similar but again decorated, this time along its full length; there is just one perforation at either end.There are however occasional plain examples in continental Europe; in two Breton finds they are in datable contexts (Elure 1982, 57 pl. 68, 58 pl. 71). An Early Bronze Age hoard from Kerivoa has one end of a plain strip tapering to a rounded terminal, where there are two small perforations. The second was associated with early Beaker material in a dolmen at Kerouaren, Plouhinec; it is parallel along its full length, not swollen like the near Winchester piece, and also differs in having one slightly expanded terminal. In addition to tiny perforations at the terminals (four and two) there are also three widely spread along the long sides. Further afield, a very similar strip to that from Winchester is illustrated and described as a diadem by Perea (1991, 50); it comes from a collective tomb at Cueva de los Murcilagos, Granada, in the south of Spain.TVC recommended valuation: 2000",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2000-01-01T00:00:00Z,,"South East",Hampshire,Winchester,"Restricted access","Winchester Area",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","British Museum",149025,images/rhenry/,"HAMP-AEA895 gold strip.jpg","Restricted info","Metal detector",,HAMP,2007-08-21T14:46:09Z,2012-04-17T17:07:57Z

In its current form, this is a roughly annular band with a small overlap. One end is a slightly thickened terminal of thin crescentic shape, the other is a thin, wavy edge most likely the product of the reworking of a broken end. It can be assumed that the original form was a penannular bracelet with two matching thickened terminals and a broad gently C-shaped band section, which survives in the reworked form. Remodelling after the loss of one terminal involved pulling the two ends together to overlap and tying them together with a thread (not surviving) passed through crude perforations. Contraction of the diameter caused the band to bend into a fairly even pentagon with obtuse angles. The object is much dented.The original ornament is very likely to have been a penannular bracelet of C-section with slightly thickened, beaded terminals. C-section bracelets occur in a few Late Bronze Age hoards, although usually with much stronger out-turned terminals.

All pieces were subjected to distortion to a greater or lesser extent prior to the hoard&#39;s deposition.

The axe is sub-triangular in plan with a narrow rounded butt that is 9mm wide, the sides expand in evenly to the cutting edge which is 49mm wide, the blade is slightly convex in shape with a prepared cutting edge which has been eroded / abraded in the soil. The blade bevel is slight. When viewed in profile the axe is lentoid (elongated oval).There is no evidence of development such as a median bevel or raised side flanges. The original patina of the axe is mostly lost through corrosion and lamination. The metal revealed is a light green colour with a dusty patina. In places small elements of possible decoration can be seen; this includes small punched depressions on the upper and lower faces - along the edge, and cabling along the long sides. These areas indistinct due to the abrasion. The axe fits with some of the earliest metal artefacts found in Britain, possibly associated with the Migdale Metalworking tradition. This would date it as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).

Although incomplete this axe best fits into the final phases of the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - decorated variant. However, it does share some of the characteristics (mostly of blade shape) of the Developed Flat Axes specifically variants Falkland and Scrabo Hill. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.   The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. There is a large horizontal break toward the butt of the axe approximately 3/4s of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The overall length is 110.4mm and the axe weighs 417 grams. The butt and small section of the upper part of the axe is missing. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent. The width at the median bevel is 41.6mm (thickness 12.7mm). Below the bevel the sides continue to expand.   The area between the median ridge and junction with the blade facet is decorated on both faces of the axe. The decoration is formed from a series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. It is bordered by the median ridge and the blade facet. Both the sides of the axe are decorated with a series of cabled decoration. This has been formed by hammering and survives better on one side where three distinct facets of the cabling can be seen.   Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 89.3mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.   The axe is a mid brown colour with a highly polished patina, which has been damaged in areas.  Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident of the blade of the axe. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident.   The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. However, this example also bears some similarities in blade shape to the Developed Early Bronze Age Axes specifically variants Falkland and Scrabo Hill. This would suggest that this example is dated to the very final phases of the Migdale tradition. A good comparison to the style of decoration can be seen in the Burgess and Schmidt Catalogue of the Axes if Northern Britain from Cuminstone (Cat No: 205).   This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest bronze axes of Britain. They are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.",,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"West Midlands",Shropshire,Shropshire,"Restricted access","East of Shrewsbury",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder",,194993,images/preavill/,"HESH-299826 illustration.jpg","Restricted info","Metal detector",,HESH,2006-12-27T16:06:16Z,2013-04-03T14:23:20Z

The upper mouth moulding is worn and chipped. The cutting edge is expanded and there are slightly developed blade tip hollows. The blade edge and blade tips are missing due to corrosion damage. There are curving striations along the same plane as the blade edge on both sides of the cutting edge and lower blade. Internal ribs on both faces. The casting seams are barely visible on both sides and on the loop. The loop is semi-circular with an oval perforation. It extends from the lower mouth moulding for 23.7mm and is 10.78mm wide. The original surface of the axe is abraded and survives in patches with a dark green patina. Exposed abraded or pitted surfaces are light green with some patches of bright green corrosion product. One side of the axe is notably more abraded and corroded (when viewed with the loop to the right). The axe has been left with the socket full of earth.

Copper-alloy ring; complete. The ring is of uneven thickness, broadening significantly for approximately one third of the circumference. There is a casting sprue at the centre on the outside of the wider edge. The object is heavily abraded and little of the original surface survives, which obscures whether the ring is narrower due to wear. Small patches of original surface do survive with a mid green patina. Otherwise, the exposed surfaces are lighter and brighter green. There are patches of cobalt blue corrosion product.

Sheet gold circular disc; flat in section. The disc has an integral down turned flange. It has four circular perforations. The disc is torn along one small portion of the edge across one of the perforations. The disc was perforated with an instrument from one side only and no efforts were made to remove the burrs created as a result of this process. Both the front and reverse of the disc are plain. The reverse has tiny flecks of copper-alloy on its surface, presumably where it was in close contact with a copper-alloy object (see notes below). Diameter: 31.14mm; Thickness: 1.04mm; Weight: 1.20g.4. Socketed knife, Thorndon type. Incomplete. The socket is rectangular in plan and elliptical in section. It is damaged and has a rough diagonal break on both sides of the socket, from just below one top corner to the opposite lower corner. One circular perforation remains intact on one face of the socket, the opposite perforation has been bisected by the break. The integral blade extends from the top of the socket and is lentoid in section. The blade edges are missing and the exposed sides are now heavily chipped and worn. The blade is truncated and terminates with a diagonal break. The blade has straight sides. The original surface of the object survives and has an olive-green patina and the exposed edges are bright green.

The finder cannot recall which way up the axe was facing. The copper alloy ring was set approximately 1cm behind the axe and the gold disc approximately 1cm behind the ring, all on the same level. It is possible that the disc 'capped' the socket of the mouth, with the copper alloy ring 'sandwiched' between. This might account for why there are traces of copper alloy on the underside of the disc. The socketed knife (no. 4) was found approximately 15cm away from the main body of the hoard, at a depth of about 20cm in disturbed plough soil. It is possible that it was deposited close to the nucleus of the hoard but not within the same deposit, and was thus more prone to disturbance.",,,"This object was reported as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 and acquired by Chelmsford Museums.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2005-08-04T23:00:00Z,,Eastern,Essex,Brentwood,"Restricted access","Mid Essex",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","Purchased by Chelmsford Museum",124649,images/cmcdonald/,"Rayner hoard comp.jpg","Restricted info","Metal detector",,ESS,2006-12-12T15:09:49Z,2013-02-01T11:23:35Z

Taunton / Cemmaes metalworking falls within Needham's (1996) Period 5, c. 1500 - 1150 BC. The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 163mm and weighs 494.8g. The butt is square and irregular with a width of 20.7mm and has a thickness of 4.0mm. The sides are slightly convex as far as the stop and are then straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade. The palstave is wider around the flanges (26.2mm), than on the blade near the stop (19.8mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished (by hammering and filing), with particular attention paid to the blade area and the unlooped side. The loop is wide at 11.5mm. The septum is rounded and concave with a straight stop, which meets the septum at a right angle. The flange facets meet the septum before the butt and are highest (37.3mm) at the stop. The stop has a height of 14.3mm above the septum and rises 9.4mm above the blade. The blade is decorated with a weak mid rib and side ribs. The ribs are defined by two small cast hollows (c. 20-28mm long and 3-4mm wide) flanking each rib. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 23.7mm and gradually thins to 12.9mm at the prominent blade facet. Hammer dimples are evident on the blade facets of both faces. Some sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are discernible. A single casting flaw on the septum of one face is visible.

Typically, low-flanged palstaves have a stop/flange breadth of no more than approx. 31mm and a stop/flange height around 10mm. A breadth of 37.1mm is closer to the criteria as defined for south-western palstaves, though that type are also characterised by angular flanges that rise above the height of the stop (Smith 1959). Examples with high flanges that do not rise above the height of the stop are known from Somerset, such as one found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012).

The 'buffer' terminal is flat and circular with a diameter of 9.66mm to 10.30mm and has a length of 5mm. The bracelet fragment has a minimum width beneath the flaring terminal of 5.79mm. The terminal displays numerous facets, presumably resulting from forging the circular-sectioned terminal. The sides of the bracelet are straight and diverge to the break where the bracelet is comparatively wide for the type at 12.56mm. The bracelet sides are 'worked-up' to form low flanges or lips on both faces with a thickness of 1.51mm (at the break) to 3mm (near the terminal) and are slightly faceted across their thickness. These flanges remain sharp and prominent on the exterior face, but appear lower on the interior of the bracelet, possibly as a result of wear. The 'ribbon' faces have been hammered flat and are plain, with a thickness of 1.1mm at the break and thickening towards the terminal. The break appears to be deliberate and may have been cut and torn to separate; cracks resulting from metal stress are evident near the break. Two incised and roughly parallel lines on the terminal may be contemporary with the use or production of the bracelet. The bracelet fragment has a weight of 10.90g.Non-destructive semi-quantitative SEM-EDX analysis was carried out by Mary Davis. Five areas on the bracelet were tested; the results varied considerably, depending on the level of wear, damage or scraping beneath the tested area. The gold composition varied between 78% - 97%, silver 2% - 14% and copper 1% - 8%. The scraped and damaged areas show a general composition consistent with similar material from Wales (Taylor (1980); Aldhouse-Green & Northover (1996)) and from Late Bronze Age bracelets from England analysed by Hook & Needham (1989). The depletion of silver and copper on the smooth and worn areas demonstrates a similar effect to other recently analysed prehistoric jewellery thought to have been in contact with the skin, which differs drastically to the analysis of protected and recessed areas on the same artefact.",1,,"This form of bracelet has been recognised by Taylor (1984) as a type, which she has termed the 'Potterne Type', after a similar bracelet found at Potterne, Wiltshire. The form corresponds to Hook and Needham's (1989) Class B1 bracelet (which may or may not have the flanges). Hook and Needham list 21 examples of Class B1 and related bracelets from Britain and Europe, with a clear concentration of the type in southern England and with a band stretching across north Wales and Cheshire. This example represents the first recorded example from south Wales.The parallel from Potterne is of very similar form but is slightly more slender with a maximum width of 8.25mm. Other examples of the Potterne type have been found at Llanarmon-yn-In in Denbighshire (Green 1984) where a heavily worn bracelet with smaller terminals but of the same type was found with other gold items (a bracelet, an ingot and a link) and deposited within the socket of a faceted axe of type Gillespie. Excavations at Brean Down, Somerset revealed an associated pair of Potterne Type bracelets and possibly a small fragment from a third. The Brean Down examples are also more slender with maximum widths of 8.2 and 9.2mm. The dating of this bracelet type can be confidently placed in the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to 950 - 750BC. The Llanarmon-yn-In bracelet was associated with a faceted axe of Ewart Park date, the Potterne find is thought to have been associated with the settlement rather than the midden with a suggested date in the mid 8th century BC. The Brean Down finds may be slightly earlier with a proposed date within the 10th - 9th centuries BC (Bell, 1990 pp71, 108).",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2005-07-31T23:00:00Z,,Wales,"the Vale of Glamorgan","the Vale of Glamorgan","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder",,87958,images/rbattye/,2005.147.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMGW,2006-01-06T10:55:40Z,2017-08-30T14:12:00Z

Length 40mm, width 21.3mm, thickness of edges < 0.1mm, thickness at tang base c. 0.2mm. Weight 1.45g.Description: This oval plaque of thin sheet gold is actually slightly asymmetrical in bowing more along one of the longer sides. In the centre of this side there is the residual stump of what would originally have been a narrow tang projecting radially outwards. Prior to the loss of the tang, therefore, the object was of a type known as a 'basket ornament', sometimes called earrings or tress rings. The plaque would have been curled into a tube and the tang then wrapped around it.The tang evidently broke off in antiquity, or perhaps was neatly removed after irreparable damage. This removed the means for attachment to clothing or body and to solve the problem two tiny, neat perforations (0.5-0.7 mm diameter) were made in the edge of the plaque immediately behind the stump of the tang. They are pierced from the incised side of the plaque and the tiny lips on the reverse have not been flattened.Linear decoration has been executed extremely lightly with a stylus. There is a band of three parallel grooves outlining the edge while two further bands cross the middle of the plaque on the shorter axis. These contain five and four grooves respectively and would have flanked either side of the tang in its original curled state.The object has suffered considerable damage, aside from the loss of the tang, most of it probably in antiquity. A cross-grid of three strong creases is the result of the plaque having been folded up neatly into a smaller 'parcel' of gold; this is the condition in which it was found. There are localised tears along some of these now unfolded creases, in one case so extensive that one end of the plaque is only attached to the rest by a narrow stretch. In addition, the whole surface is buckled and creased.Discussion: There is no doubt that in its original form the gold item was an ornament of the 'basket' type. This type is among the earliest gold-work in Britain, dating to the phase of copper usage prior to the adoption of bronze, circa 25th - 22nd centuries BC. Some are known in pairs and occur in early Beaker graves (for example that of the celebrated Amesbury Archer), but the folding of this example may suggest another context of deposition and recalls the as-found condition of the Stogursey basket ornament (Treasure Annual Report 1998-9, no. 1). The function of basket-shaped ornaments is unknown, but from their position in graves they may have been used as hair ornaments or ear-rings.",,,"The object was on the surface of the plough-soil and no related objects were found.

One end is a narrow, twisty rod of round section, possibly an original terminal. This flares into a 'tab' the end of which is not certainly intact. It is therefore possible it continued as a longer ribbon. This tab is flat between gently convex sides which are thickened as beadings of triangular section. Extant length 24.3 mm; max, width 12.2 mm; diameter of rod 2.2-3.2 mm; max. thickness beadings 2.4 mm; thickness of ribbon centre 0.5 mm; weight 3.5 g The uncertainty as to whether this piece is broken makes it difficult to be sure of its identification. However, its features do match those of a type of bracelet which occurs in just two Welsh hoards, from Capel Isaf, Dyfed, and Maesmelan Farm, Powys. The type, known as Capel Isaf, comprises a flat band strengthened by triangular-section beadings along either edge. At either terminal the band tapers quickly to a hooked tang, one of which is rod-like, the other a flatter strip; these two interlock to close the bracelet. The Northfleet fragment appears to have had a narrower band than the Welsh parallels, but its metal composition is similar with low copper and between about 9 and 16 % silver. Making this identification does not necessarily offer definitive dating since the type is not associated with datable objects. The Capel Isaf hoard contains, in addition to two of this type, two more broad-band bracelets which are plainer in design, and a small fragment of twisted strip which is likely to be the terminal of another ornament (Savory 1977; Savory 1980, no 302, 195 fig. 46, pl. VIII). The Maesmelan Farm hoard has a simple rectangular section penannular bracelet in association with one of Capel Isaf type (Green et al 1983). The prevailing opinion is that these are of Bronze Age date and, if so, they are likely to date to before the middle of the Bronze Age (circa 1500/1400 BC), after which the copper content of the gold rises significantly. A mature Early Bronze Age or earliest Middle Bronze Age date is feasible and would tie in with a similar date for the Heyope ribbon torcs with similar terminals from a hoard in Powys.",,,"Treasure case 2004/T326.

The presence of a base metal core was subsequently confirmed in the laboratory. Maximum external diameter 18mm; maximum thickness of hoop 6mm; weight 9.61 grams.

The ends of the ring are flat and are 1.5mm apart.  A copper-alloy core is suggested as the sheath is cracked on one of the exterior faces near to one terminal.  Within in this crack a dark brown colour can be seen, this is likely to be dirt.  Lighter transverse circumference lines can be seen around the gold sheath, this creates an over all effect of alternate stripes of yellow and silver metal.  This is known as 'banding' and appears on many examples of 'ring-money'. These may be strips of a slightly different alloy.  The function of 'ring-money' is unknown; they date mainly to the Late Bronze Age, between 1150-750BC.

The ring has a diameter of 15.5 mm and it is sub-square or sub-circular in cross-section, measuring 5 mm deep and 5 mm wide; the faces are most flattened near to the terminals. The ends of the ring butt right up against each other and are joined by corrosion from the core. A copper-alloy core is suggested by green corrosion products in two places, both on the interior surface of the ring; behind the terminals, and where the gold sheath has cracked on the opposite side from the terminals. Further damage to the gold sheath, on both exterior faces near one terminal, shows the core as light brown; this may be dirt. There are lighter transverse lines on the interior face, apparently petering out close to the terminals. The finished surfaces are not particularly regular, with slight facets that may be hammer marks. The function of penannular rings is unknown; they date mainly to the Late Bronze Age. For other examples from Suffolk, see MNL 132 (two, both solid) and TYN 047 (a single solid banded example).Gill Varndell of the British Museum has examined this object, and her report (20.02.2002) reads: ""A penannular ring of slightly sub-rectangular cross-section, the terminals very close together.

The internal surface has traces of paler gold bandig which has been worn off the external surface. There is green corrosion internally, across both terminals and oposite them; this probably derives from the base metal core (see below). There is damage to the surface near one terminal and a small area of the gold wrapping is absent; there is some lifting of the wrapping especially at the terminal surfaces.

This axe has slightly concave sides, which diverge gently towards an expanded blade end. The butt of the axe has been broken off in antiquity. There is some evidence that the axe was deliberately damaged; the profile has been slightly bent at the butt end, implying considerable force, and there are linear marks on both butt end surfaces aligned at right angles to the axis of the blade. These would appear to be deliberate blows from a narrow bladed implement, such as another axe. The blade edge is extremely eroded and the axe surface is heavily pock marked, having a green patina, with patches of lighter green carbonate deposit. This may be identified as a bronze flat axe of the Type Migdale/Class 3 belonging to period 2 of the Early Bronze Age (circa 2300 - 2050 cal BC) in Britain (Needham 1983; 1996; Schmidt & Burgess 1981). These are the earliest bronze axes of Britain, which were in use at the same time as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Parallels for this axe, within the National Collection are examples from Usk, Monmouthshire and Whitchurch, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, Cat Nos. 106 & 107).",,,"Flat axes are usually found as single finds and separate from settlement and burials of this time. As a consequence, it proves very difficult to date them because of the lack of associations with other material culture and human activity. At present, less than 100 flat axes have been recorded from Wales, spanning a time period from 1500-1900 BC. Therefore each single new find adds significantly to the picture of early metal use here (Gwilt 1999). The probable evidence of deliberate breakage of this axe is interesting, suggesting either breakage prior to recycling and re-smelting or deliberate breakage as part of a ritual involving the burial of the axe within the ground. It is unlikely that a modern plough would have caused such focussed and directional damage to the axe. It is probable that this axe was cast and made in Britain; axes of this shape may be found all over Wales, Scotland and England. In Wales, Bronze Age copper mines have been located and excavated on Anglesey, at the Great Orme, near Llandudno and on Copa Hill Cwmystwyth in mid Wales. However, the earliest radiocarbon dated activity at the Welsh mines belongs to the middle of the Early Bronze Age (circa 1900cal BC), which is after the currency of the Type Migdale flat axe. The earliest copper mining evidence from Northern Europe comes from Ross Island in County Kerry in Western Ireland, with mining occurring between 2500 - 2150BC. However these mines probably supplied ore to make the earliest copper axe types, which are particularly common in Ireland, yet rare in Britain. A mould for making flat axes has been found at Betws-y-Coed, Conwy, showing the technology did exist for flat axe production and casting in Wales, even if the metal source remains speculative.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2000-12-01T00:00:00Z,,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder","returned to finder",,images/pmacdonald/,,"Restricted info","Metal detector",,NMGW,2001-10-16T00:00:00Z,2017-07-27T16:25:02Z

Length 220mm and 32mm wide across the widest part of the leaf-shaped blade. The socket, encircled by three lightly engraved lines, is 50mm and 16-17mm in diameter at the mouth where it is approximately circular in cross section; further up, the section is sharply angular. Because part of the wooden shaft remains firmly wedged in place it is not possible to known how far the hollow socket extends. There are two neatly formed loops at the base of the blade, one a little larger and lower than the other. The two halves of the mould have been very slightly misaligned and the thickness of the socket metal varies around its circuit. There is a small blow hole in one side of the spine just above the loops. The weapon is not worn or smoothed by the sea and there are stains on the blade which suggest that it had laid until recently in some peaty soil. It is probable, therefore, that it had been recently eroded from coastal peats.The metal is in good condition with a fairly uniform matt surface of blue/purple colour; nowhere is the patination shiny, which may be an effect of salt water and sand. The edges of the blade have been sharpened in the middle section in antiquity, creating a slightly ragged, thinner edge; the bottom of the socket has also seen a little damage which may have occurred during use. This spearhead falls within Davis&#39; (2012) Type 8A spearhead (flame-shaped blade, incorporated basal-loops) and can be dated broadly to the Taunton phase (1400-1275 BC) (Davis 2012,133-134). It is recorded in Davis&#39; (2012) corpus: No.741, Pl.45. The spearhead can be paralleled in the Taunton hoard itself and in the Stibbard hoard from Norfolk. In Wales the closest parallel is the very splendid weapon from Nebo near Llanrwst which is twice the length but has the same angular socket and essentially leaf-shaped blade (Bezant Lowe 1912, 47; Ellis Davies 1929, 342). A spearhead from the river at Hay on Wye is of similar date but has a rather more complex section across the blade (Savory 1980, 112, fig.27).",,,"The coastal area of Merioneth on either side of the Maddach has produced quite a number of chance finds of bronze implement over the years (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 109-28). The palstave is the main working tool of the period and there are several of both Middle and Late Bronze Age date; but in addition there are a surprising number of weapons. A spear, now lost, from Barmouth had loops on the socket, so probably belonged to an earlier phase than the Tal y Bont one; those from Llanfrathen and Brithir are without loops and belong to the Late Bronze Age. The famous Cwm Moch hoard contains spears with basal loops but a rather more triangular blade which indicates a date in the Penard phase, about 1200 cal BC. This hoard also contains rapiers, the quintessential Middle Bronze Age weapon, soon to be replaced by the leaf-shaped sword which first appears in this phase. Rapiers are rather rare everywhere, but Merioneth has produced another from the Cwm Moch area. Two fine gold torcs (twisted &#39;neck rings&#39; but long enough to be used as a belt) have been found, one near Harlech and the other on the slopes of Cadair Idris. At a slightly later date a splendid bronze shield was buried in a bog near Gwern Einion and a rare bronze bucket was similarly offered to the gods at Arthog (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 126-7). Coastal Merioneth may therefore be regarded as a region of wealth and splendour in the Bronze Age.
